Toda vida, é
É amar você
Amar você

O seu amor é como uma chama acesa
Queima de prazer
De prazer

Eu já falei com Deus que não vou te deixar
Vou te levar pra onde for
Qualquer lugar
Já fiz de tudo pra não te perder

Arerê,
Um lobby, um hobby, um love com você

Não dá pra tirar da cabeça
Seus olhos, seus beijos, você
Eu vivo sonhando acordado
Pensando em te ver

Seu jeito me deixa sem jeito
Sua voz toca o meu coração
Saudade machuca meu peito
Não demore não

Você é a razão da minha vida
Meu céu, meu ar o meu chão
Meu sonho, meu porto seguro a minha paixão
Preciso sentir seu carinho
Sozinho posso enlouquecer
Me leva pra sempre em seus braços
Eu amo você


Tô contando as horas
Contando os minutos
Os segundos pra te ver
Uououo vem pra mim
Que eu sou louco por você


Tô contando as horas
Contando os minutos
Os segundos pra te ver
Uououo vem pra mim
Eu não vivo sem você",pt

Quero ficar só contigo, não vou poder voar.
Pra que parar pra refletir se meu reflexo é você?
Aprendendo uma só vida, compartilhando prazer.

Por que parece que na hora eu não vou aguentar,
Se eu sempre tive força e nunca parei de lutar?
Como num filme no final tudo vai dar certo.
Quem foi que disse que pra tá junto precisa tá perto?

Pensa em mim
Que eu tô pensando em você
E me diz
O que eu quero te dizer
Vem pra cá, pra ver que juntos estamos
E te falar
Mais uma vez que te amo

O tempo que passamos juntos vai ficar pra sempre,
Intimidades, brincadeiras, só a gente entende.
Pra quem fala que namorar é perder tempo eu digo:
Ha muito tempo eu não cresci o que eu cresci contigo.

Juntos no balanço da rede, sob o céu estrelado,
sempre acontece, o tempo para quando eu to do seu lado
A noite chega eu fecho os olhos é você que eu vejo,
Como queria estar contigo eu paro e faço um desejo:

Pensa em mim
Que eu tô pensando em você
E me diz
O que eu quero te dizer

I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed

When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre,
now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem,
and the hoes they wanna fuck
But homie ain't nothing change ho's down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cut
that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move
you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I dont walk wit a limp
In the hood, in L.A. they saying ""50 you hot""
They like me,
I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York
them niggas'll tell ya im loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm feelin' focused man, my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shawty said she feeling my style,
she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend wanna get bi

My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look nigga I done came up and I ain't change.

And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga you mad?
I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that faggot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?
When my junk get to pumpin in the club it's on
I wink my eye at ya bitch,
if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking bout money homie,
I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me

If the niggas hate then let 'em hate
Watch the money pile up
Or we go upside their head

Clara e salgada
Cabe em um olho
E Pesa uma tonelada

Tem sabor de mar
Pode ser discreta
Inquilina da dor
Morada predileta

Na calada ela vem
Refém da vingança
Irmã do desespero
Rival da esperança

Pode ser causada por
Vermes e mundanas
E o espinho da flor
Cruel que você ama

Amante do drama
Vem pra minha cama, por querer
Sem me perguntar, me fez sofrer

E eu que me julguei forte
E eu que me senti
Serei um fraco quando outras delas vir

Se o barato é louco e o processo é lento
No momento, deixa eu caminhar contra o vento

O que adianta eu ser durão e o coração ser vulnerável?
O vento não, ele é suave, mas é frio e implacável

(É quente)
Borrou a letra triste do poeta
(Só)
Correu no rosto pardo do profeta

Verme, sai da reta
A lágrima de um homem vai cair
Esse é o seu B.O. pra eternidade

Diz que homem não chora
Tá bom, falou
Não vai pra grupo irmão
Aí, Jesus chorou

Porra, vagabundo
Ó, vou te falar
Tô chapando
Eita, mundo bom de acabar!

O que fazer quando a fortaleza tremeu
E quase tudo ao seu redor
Melhor, se corrompeu?

Epa, pera lá! Muita calma, ladrão
Cadê o espírito imortal do Capão?
Lave o rosto nas águas sagradas da pia
Nada como um dia após o outro dia?

Que?

Quem sou eu, seu lado direito
Tá abalado? Por que veio?
Nego, é desse jeito!?

Durmo mal, sonho quase a noite inteira
Acordo tenso, tonto e com olheira
Na mente, sensação de mágoa e rancor
Uma fita me abalou na noite anterior

Alô!
Aí! Dorme, hein, doidão! Mil fita acontecendo e cê ai?
Que horas são?
Meio dia e vinte, ó
A fita é o seguinte, ó
Não é esqueirando não, ó
Fita de mil grau.
Ontem eu tava ali de Cb, no pião
Com um truta firmezão
Cê tem que conhecer
Se pã, cê liga ele
Vai saber, de repente
Ele fazia até um rap num passado recente.
Aham.
vai vendo a fita
Cê não acredita
Quando tem que ser, é, jão. Pres'tenção
Vai vendo, parei pra fumar um de remédio
Com uns moleque lá e pá, trafica nos prédios
Um que chegou depois, pediu pra dar uns 2
Logo um patrício, ó, novão e os carai
Fumaça vai, fumaça vem
ele chapou o coco
Se abriu que nem uma flor, ficou louco
Tava eu mais dois truta e uma mina
Num Tempra prata show filmado, ouvindo Guina
Ih, o bico se atacou, ó! Falou uma pá do cê
Tipo o que?
Esse Brown aí é cheio de querer ser
Deixa ele moscar, vir cantar na quebrada
Vamo ver se é isso tudo quando ver as quadrada
Periferia nada, só pensa nele mesmo
Montado no dinheiro e cês aí no veneno?
E a cara dele, truta?
Cada um no seu corre
Tudo pelas verde
Uns matam, outros morrem
Eu mesmo, se eu catar, a boa numa hora dessa
Vou me destacar pro outro lado depressa
Vou comprar uma house de boy, depois alugo
Vão me chamar de senhor, não por vulgo
Mas pra ele só a Zona Sul que é a pá
Diz que ele tira nós, nossa cara é cobrar
O que ele quiser nós quer, vem que tem
Porque eu não pago pau pra ninguém.?
E eu, só registrei, né? Não era de lá
Os mano tudo só ouviu, ninguém falou um A
Quem tem boca fala o que quer pra ter nome
Pra ganhar atenção das mulher e/ou dos homem
Amo minha raça, luto pela cor
O que quer que eu faça é por nós, por amor
Não entende o que eu sou, não entende o que eu faço
Não entende a dor e as lágrimas do palhaço

Mundo em decomposição por um triz
Transforma um irmão meu num verme infeliz
E a minha mãe diz:
Paulo, acorda! Pensa no futuro que isso é ilusão
Os próprio preto não tá nem aí com isso não
Ó o tanto que eu sofri, o que eu sou, o que eu fui
A inveja mata um, tem muita gente ruim.
Pô, mãe! Não fala assim que eu nem durmo
Meu amor pela senhora já não cabe em Saturno.

Dinheiro é bom
Quero, sim, se essa é a pergunta
Mas a dona Ana fez de mim um homem e não uma puta!

Ei, você,seja lá quem for
Pra semente eu não vim
Então, sem terror

Inimigo invisível,Judas incolor
Perseguido eu já nasci, demorou

Apenas por 30 moeda o irmão corrompeu
Atire a primeira pedra quem tem rastro meu

Cadê meu sorriso? Onde tá? Quem roubou?
Humanidade é má e até Jesus chorou
Lágrimas, lágrimas
Jesus chorou

Vermelho e azul, hotel
Pisca só no cinza escuro do céu

Chuva cai lá fora e aumenta o ritmo
Sozinho, eu sou agora o meu inimigo íntimo

Lembranças más vêm, pensamentos bons vai
Me ajude, sozinho eu penso merda pra carai

Gente que acredito, gosto e admiro
Brigava por justiça e paz, levou tiro
Malcolm X, Ghandi, Lennon, Marvin Gaye
Che Guevara, 2pac, Bob Marley
E o evangélico Martin Luther King

Lembrei de um truta meu falar assim:
Não joga pérolas aos porco, irmão, joga lavagem
Eles prefere assim, cê tem de usar piolhagem!

Cristo que morreu por milhões
Mas só andou com apenas 12 e um fraquejou

Periferia: corpos vazios e sem ética
Lotam os pagode, rumo à cadeira elétrica

Eu sei, você sabe o que é frustração
Máquina de fazer vilão

Eu penso mil fita, vou enlouquecer
E o piolho diz assim quando me vê:
Famoso pra carai, durão! Ih, truta!
Faz seu mundo, não, jão! A vida é curta
Só modelo por aí dando boi
Põe elas pra chupar e manda andar depois
Rasgar as madrugadas só de mil e cem
Se sou eu, truta, tem pra ninguém!
Zé povinho é o cão, tem esses defeito
Quê? Cê tendo ou não, cresce os olhos de qualquer jeito
Cruzar, cê arrebenta
De repentemente, vai, de ponto quarenta
Só querer, tá no pente

Se só de pensar em matar, já matou
Eu prefiro ouvir o pastor

?Filho meu, não inveje o homem violento
E nem siga nenhum dos seus caminhos?

Lágrimas

Molha a medalha de um vencedor
Chora agora, ri depois
Aí, Jesus chorou

There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love

There's love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares of joyful giving

If we try we shall see
In this bliss
We cannot feel fear or dread
We stop existing and start living

Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace

Wound this earth, crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly, be God's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel
You are all my brothers

Create a world with no fear
Together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords
Into plowshares

Ain't never met a girl that can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come
Where you would get up and run
And I would be out chasing you
Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be,
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely

And it's drivin me crazy cause I'm so...

Verse One: Tupac
First off, fuck your bitch in the clit you claim

You claim to be a player but I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boy niggaz fucked for life
Plus Puffy tryin ta see me weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smallz and Junior M.A.F.I.A. some mark ass bitches
We keep on comin' while we runnin for ya jewels
steady gunnin, keep on bustin at the fools, you know the rules
Little Ceaser, go ask ya homie how I leave ya
cut your young ass up, leave you in pieces, now be deceased
Lil Kim, don't fuck around with real G's
Quick to snatch yo' ugly ass off tha street, so fuck peace
I let them niggas know it's on for life
So let the West side ride tonight hahahah
Bad Boy murdered on wax, and killed
Fuck wit' me and get ya caps peeled, you know ... see ...

Chorus:
Grab ya glocks, when you see Tupac
Call the cops, when you see Tupac, uhh
Who shot me, but ya punks didn't finish
Now ya bout to feel the wrath of a menace
NIGGA, I hit em' up...

Interlude: Tupac
Check this out, you muthafuckas know what time it is
I don't even know why I'm on this track
ya'll nigguz ain't even on my level
I'ma let my little homies ride on you
bitch made-ass bad boy bitches -- deal with it!!
Verse Two:
Get out the way yo, get out the way yo
Biggie Smallz just got dropped
Little Moo, pass the Mac, and let me hit him in his back
Frank White need to get spanked right, for settin tracks
little accident murderer, and I ain't never heard-a ya
Poisinous gats attack when I'm servin ya
Spank the shank ya whole style when I dank
Guard your rank, cause I'ma slam you in the pavement
Puffy weaker that a fuckin rocka wanna do, nigga
and, I'll smoke ya junior mafia in front of you, nigga
With the ready power tuckin my Guess under my Eddie Bauer
ya clout, pretty sour I get packages every hour
and hit em up

Chorus

Verse Three: Tupac
Peep how we do it, keep it real, it's penitentiary steel
this aint no freestyle battle, all you niggaz gettin
killed with ya mouths open
tryin to come up offa me, you in the clouds hoping
smokin dope it's like a sherm high
Niggaz think they learned to fly
But they burned muthafucka, you deserve to die
Talkin bout you gettin money, but its funny to me
All you niggaz living bummy, while you fuckin' wit me
I'm a self made milionare
Thug Livin out a prison, pistols in the air, hahaha
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on my couch
and beg the bitch to let you sleep in the house, ahh
Now its all about Versacci, you copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it, and smiled
Now I'm bout to set the record straight, with my AK
I'm still the thug you love to hate
Motherfucker, I hit em up

Verse Four:
I'm from N-E-W Jerz, where plenty murders occur
No points to be calmer, we bringin drama to all you heards
Knuckle check the scenario, Little Cease
I bring you fake G's to your knees
Coppin pleas cuz this ain't your area
Lil Kim, is you coked up, or doped up?
Get ya lil Junior Whopper click smoked up, what the fuck
is you STUPID?!?! I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
with my click lootin, shootin and pollutin ya block
with 15 shots cock glock to your knot
Outlaw mafia click movin up another notch
And you bast stops squaws get mopped and dropped
All your fake-ass east coast props brainstormed and locked
Verse Four:
Youse a, beat biter, a Pac style taker
I'll tell you to ya face you aint shit but a faker
Softer than Alize with a chaser
Bout to get murdered for the paper
Idi Amin approach the scene
Write a caper, like a loc, with little ceaser in a choke hold
Totin smoke, we aint no muthafuckin joke
Thug Life, niggaz betta be knowin, we approchin
in the wide open, guns smokin
no need for hopin its a battle lost, I got across
Soon as the funk was poppin off
Nigga I hit em up

Outro: Tupac
Now you tell me who won
I see them, they run
They don't wanna see us
Whole Junior M.A.F.I.A. click dressin up tryin ta be us
How the fuck they gonna be the mob when we always on our job
We millionaires, killin ain't fair but somebody gotta do it
Oh yeah, Mobb Deep, you wanna fuck with us?
You little young ass motherfuckers
Don't one of you niggaz got sickle cell or somethin?
You fuckin with me nigga you fuck around

But we ain't singin, we bringin drama
Fuck you and your motherfuckin mama

Now when I came out I told you it was just about Biggie
Then everybody had to open their mouth with a motherfuckin opinion

Theres nothing you can't do,
Now you're in New York,
These streets will make you feel brand new,
The lights will inspire you,
Lets hear it for New York, New York, New York
Welcome to the bright light...

[Jay-Z]
Lights is blinding,
Girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick,
The side lines is blind with casualties,
Who sipping life casually,
then gradually become worse,
Don't bite the apple Eve,
Caught up in the in crowd,
Now your in-style,
And in the winter gets cold en vogue with your skin out,
The city of sin is a pity on a whim,
Good girls gone bad, the cities filled with them,
Mommy took a bus trip and now she got her bust out,
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route,
Hail Mary to the city your a Virgin,
And Jesus can't save you,
life starts when the church ends,
Came here for school, graduated to the high life,
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight,
MDMA got you feeling like a champion,
The city never sleeps
better slip you a Ambien

[Chorus]
In New York,
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of,
Theres nothing you can't do,
Now you're in New York,
These streets will make you feel brand new,
The lights will inspire you,
Lets hear it for New York, New York, New York

[Alicia Keys]
One hand in the air for the big city,
Street lights, big dreams all looking pretty,
No place in the World that can compare,
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say yeaaahh
Come on, come,
Yeah,

[Chorus]
In New York,
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of,
Theres nothing you can't do,
Now you're in New York,
These streets will make you feel brand new,
The lights will inspire you,
Lets hear it for New York, New York, New York",en

Felicidade, é estar contigo todo dia
Felicidade, é sentir o cheiro dessa flor
Felicidade, é saber que eu tenho seu amor

Felicidade, é saber de verdade
Que a gente sente saudade
Quando não consegue se ver

Felicidade, é acordar do seu lado
Tomar um café reforçado
Depois sair pra correr com você

Felicidade, é poder jogar um pano
Colar no show do Caetano
Cantar 'Odara' até o dia raiar

Curtir uma praia bacana

I got the floor, I'm tryna see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof

Blind eyes colored guide me to see the truth

But I'ma +Leave it to+
God, not +Beaver+

Cause I'ma murder, why I kill ol' and even you?
Man, I got Summer hating on me cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got Spring hating on me cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hating on me cause I'm colder than ya'll
And I would never, I would never, I would never Fall
I'm being hated on by the seasons
So f**k ya'll who hating for no reason!

I call them +April+ Babies, cause they +Fools+
And when they snooze,
We Up
Feet Up

In a red and yellow thang old school Atlanta Hawk

Go further
Go harder

Why we came? and if not,
Then why bother?

Now my name's being mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggie's and the Pac's and the Marley's and the Marcuses

Can't stop the blows *Kaboom*

Stare at my wardrobe

From this rap game

I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dogs, no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl wanna dig out
Hooked it up on later as I hit the do'
Thinking will i live, another twenty-fo'
I gotta go cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Looking in my mirror not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin y'all
Which court, are y'all playin basketball?
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple double
Freaking brothers everyway like M.J.
I can't believe, today was a good day

Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin, didn't even look in a niggaz direction
as I ran the intersection
Went to $hort Dog's house, they was watchin Yo! MTV
Raps
What's the haps on the craps
Shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
Roll em in a circle of niggaz and watch me break em
With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
Seven even back do' Joe I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin domino
and now i am yelling dominoes
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.
Today was a good day

Left my niggaz house paid
Picked up a girl been tryin to fuck since the twelve
grade
It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics I felt on the big
fat
fanny
Pulled out the jammy, and killed the punanny
And my dick runs deep so deep so deep
put her ass to sleep Woke her up around one
she didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coasting
Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel
motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off, then I chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams
No helicopter looking for a murder
Two in the morning got the fat burger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read Ice Cube's a pimp
Drunk as hell but no throwing up
Half way home and my pager still blowing up
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K.
I got to say it was a good day.

My life got flipped, turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince
of a town called Bel-Air

In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out,maxin',relaxin',all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up in no good
Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said: You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air

I begged and pleaded with her day after day,
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put wy Walkman on and said, ""I might as well kick it.""
First class, yo, this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air live like?
Hmm...this might be alright

But wait, I here their Prissy, Booz wine-in all.
Is this the type of place that they should send this cool-cat?
I don't think so, I'll see when I get there,
I hope their prepared for the prince of Bel-Air!

Well-a plane landed and when I came out
there was a dude dressed like a cop stand'n there
with my name out, ""I ant' try to get arrested yet
I just got here!"" I flew like the quickness of light'en disapper.

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said fresh and had a dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought, ""Now, forget it. Yo home to Bel-Air!""

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
And I yelled to the cab yo home smell you later
Looked at my kingdom I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air.",en

Eu estava morto, mas sei que hoje vivo
Duas décadas no Hip-Hop
Tomem meu fruto, prove

Eu sei quem sou
Sei pra onde vou
Sei de onde vim
E sei quem aqui me colocou
Jesus é o jardineiro e as árvores somos nós
Ao som da sua voz, minha alma florece
Frutos nascem, flores crescem
Ele entrou na minha casa, ele entrou na minha vida
Cuidou de cada folha, cuidou de cada galho
Fez em terra seca germinar copa bonita
Eu sou a semente que não secou no Sol
Sou a semente que o pássaro não devorou
Sou a semente que o espinho não sufocou
Eu sou a árvore de bons frutos e foi Deus quem me
plantou

Árvore que não produz nada vira lenha,
Só serve pra queimar e vira cinza na fogueira
Purifica o clima, gera bons frutos

Eu vou fazer tudo que a palavra me diz, pois machado
nenhum vai cortar a minha raiz

Eu mando um salve pros Gf's que me querem bem
Os guerreiros do futuro que não tremem pra ninguém
Sei que são muitos
Sei que tão em várias missões
Se multiplicam diariamente e já passam de milhões
Estão em vários, bairros, quebradas, estados e é
sempre um prazer poder revisitá-los
Uns tão brotando
Outros já tão produzindo
Alguns estão cansados, suas folhas tão caindo
Tem problema não, deixa aqui com nós chefão
Peço apenas que abençoe toda essa nova geração
Onde eu vou canto amor
Onde chego levo paz
É por isso que tenho o carinho dos filhos
E tenho também o respeito dos pais
Minhas letras são plantas medicinais
Sem efeitos colaterais
Sem patentes multinacionais
Elas curam drogados e evitam abortos
Aliviam cansaços
Botam sorrisos em rostos

Árvore que não produz nada vira lenha, só serve pra
queimar e vira cinza na fogueira
Purifica o clima, gera bons frutos

Eu vou fazer tudo que a palavra me diz, pois machado
nenhum vai cortar a minha raiz

Olha pro Amazonas
Lá tem árvores pra caramba
Tem várias lá em Minas que tão firmes e não tombam
Na Bahia só valente, troncos fortes, e raízes
No Df os pomares estão verdes e viris
Ei Rio, quem te viu, a floresta sobe morro e desce o
outro lado
Arrebenta o concreto e brota até no asfalto
É tanta planta rara, sai até da areia da praia
Pernambuco também tem demais
Doces frutos em Goiás
Santa Catarina é só fruta docinha
São Paulo, terra minha
Tenho aqui frondosos conterrâneos
Só madeira de lei no Amapá, Espírito Santo
Nem o frio impede que a colheita seja farta lá em
Porto Alegre


Árvore que não produz nada vira lenha, só serve pra
queimar e vira cinza na fogueira
Purifica o clima, gera bons frutos

Eu vou fazer tudo que a palavra me diz, pois machado
nenhum vai cortar a minha raiz


Essa é uma canção dedicada a todas as sementes
Que cairam em terra seca
Mas mesmo assim produziram bons frutos em seu tempo
Que enfrentaram aves de agouro
Que enfrentaram espinhos
Que enfrentaram o Sol
Mas venceram e se transformaram em grandes árvores
Grandes árvores

Jesus é o jardineiro e as árvores somos nós
Somos, Somos nós

Gone as quick as it came

You were doing your thing

How many scholarships?
How many properties did you
Donate to the people in poverty?
Man, I bet if any, it's not enough probably
Made it equivalent to hitting the lottery
Selfish just make you a target for robbery
Could it be possibly you don't
Know people are starving and dying
Is this shit not on your mind?

What is you thinking 'bout, just
'Cause you make it out
Don't mean you shit on
People tryna be equal
Every day fighting oppression
And you just gon' side with the evil
Man, what do you care about?
Did you not hear about
Black women missing?
We don't know their whereabouts
See that's what you should
Be calling the mayor about
Offer whatever is a fair amount
There's a water crisis down in Flint
And ain't you from Michigan?

Where is your empathy, nigga?
I promise you I see the
Bitch in these niggas

Cuz they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)

I know you feel where I'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On a carousel, so around I spun
With no direction, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none

It's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinking ""maybe I should get it out""
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering,
If there was something that you wanna know
But never mind that, we should let it go
Cause we don't wanna be a t.v. episode
And all the bad thoughts, just let em go, go, go

Plus you pay your taxes
And you keep it real, while them others stay plastic
You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr. Fantastic
Stop- now think about it

Even way out there in Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming

Back where I belong
Yeah I never felt so strong
(I'm back baby)
I feel like there's nothing that I can't try
and if you with me put your hands high
(put your hands high)

If you ever lost a light before, this one's for you
And you, the dreams are for you

I hear ""The Tears of a Clown""
I hate that song
Ialways feel like they talking to me when it comes on
Another day another dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math I'm gone
What am I s'posed to do when the club lights come on
It's easy to be Puff, it's harder to be Sean
What if the twins ask why I ain't marry their mom
(why, damn!)
How do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown
Damn!
But I ain't finished growing
Another night the inevitible prolongs
Another day another dawn
Just tell Keisha and Taresha I'll be better in the morn'
Another lie that I carry on
I need to get back to the place I belong

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
""A house is Not a Home"", I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone
And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
But you felt it and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, play ball and we keep ballin'
Baby, we've been living in sin
'Cause we've been really in love
But we've been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your home
Pick up your phone, come on

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
""Ain't No Stopping Us Now"", I love that song
Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
We back cruising through Harlem, Viso blocks
It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away then embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming
Yeah it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog

And here I stand, a better man!

Tava querendo um tema, Para cantar sobre um tema,
Mais essa não vai ter tema, Então sem tema é o tema
Pra que não haja problema, pra que entenda o meu tema
Para quebrar as algemas pra que do tema tu não tema

Tema)Que faz a letra, letra que faz a levada
Levada que faz o RAP, Revolução desarmada
Armada só se de rima, cansada da uma parada
Levanta não desanima, jornada mal começada
A métrica estudada, com o tempo aprimorei

Certifiquei, ouvi colei pensei num sampler do GREN DAY
Errei, continuei pois nada me desanima
Não é a falta de tema que vai parar minha rima
Senti o clima então chamei o Praff pra produzir
Pra minha rima conduzir, pra minha vida prosseguir
Pra ninguém achar defeito, pra que o RAP surta efeito
Pra que mude seu conceito, pra que flua de dentro do peito

Sem um tema especifico, uso a massa cefalica
Meu rap é metafisico, me sinto numa cama hiperbarica
Respeita o rap que forma o meu sujeito
Não sou eu que faço RAP, é de RAP que eu sou feito!


REFRÃO (2x)
RAP sem tema sem problema a gente faz
Nosso esquema é fazer rima de paz


(BULL)
Os louco já se antena quando se arma o esquema
Já faz os telefonema cola na cena pro rap
O tema é mesmo Sem Tema, mas rimas tenho centenas
São verdadeiros poemas que bota os falsos em cheque
Por isso eu vou curtir, com todos os parças que tá
Sentindo a vibe fluir, e isso aí já bastá

O rap faz prosseguir, o rap me faz sonhar
Eu sei que quem tá aqui, é por que gosta rapá
Já são vinte e poucos anos entre acertos e enganos
A cada mês cada ano a cada dia mais planos
Eu sigo pensando tramando bolando
Perdendo ou Ganhando. eu continuo sonhando

O rap feito de alma e sempre com sentimento
mesmo escutado com calma acelera os batimentos
faz esquecer todos traumas faz eu viver os momentos
A toda flora e fauna aqui é 5º elemento

Eu não tinha nada que fome que eu tinha
Que seca danada no meu Ceará
Eu peguei e juntei um restinho
De coisas que eu tinha
Duas calça velha e uma violinha
E num pau-de-arara toquei para cá
E de noite eu ficava na praia de Copacabana
Zanzando na praia de Copacabana
Cantando o xaxado pras moças olhar
Virgem Santa! Que a fome era tanta
Que nem voz eu tinha
Meu Deus quanta moça, que fome que eu tinha...
Zanzando na praia pra lá e pra cá


(Recitado) Foi aí então que eu arresolvi a comer gilete...Tinha um cumpadre meu lá de Quixeramubim que ganhou um dinheirão comendo gilete na praia de Copacabana. Eu não sei não, mas eu acho que ele comeu tanta, mas tanta, que quando eu cheguei lá aquela gente toda já estava até com indigestão de tanto ver o cabra comer gilete. Uma vez eu disse assim prum moço que vinha passando: Ô decente, vosmecê não deixa eu comer uma giletezinha pra vosmecê ver?
""Tu não te manca não, ô Pau-de-Arara?""
""Só uma, que eu ainda não comi nadinha hoje.""
""Você enche, ein?""
Aquilo me deixou tão aperreado que se não fosse o amor que eu tinha na minha violinha, eu tinha rebentado ela na cabeça daquele...filho de uma égua!


(Cantado) Puxa vida, não tinha uma vida pior do que a minha
Que vida danada que fome que eu tinha
Mais fome que eu tinha no meu Ceará
Quando eu via toda aquela gente num come-que-come
Eu juro que tinha saudade da fome
Da fome que eu tinha no meu Ceará
E aí eu pegava e cantava e dançava o xaxado
E só conseguia porque no xaxado
A gente só pode mesmo se arrastar
Virgem Santa! A fome era tanta que mais parecia
Que mesmo xaxando meu corpo subia
Igual se tivesse querendo voar


(Recitado) Às vezes a fome era tanta que volta e meia a gente arrumava uma briguinha pra ver se pegava a bóia lá do xadrez. Êta quentinho bom no estômago! Com perdão da palavra, a gente devolvia tudo depois, que a bóia já vinha estragada. Mas enquanto ela ficava quietinha lá dentro, que felicidade! Não, mas agora as coisas tão melhorando. Tem uma dona lá no Lebron que gosta muito de ver é eu comer caco de “vrídrio”. Com isso eu já juntei uns quinhentos merréis. Quando juntar um pouco mais, vou-me embora, volto pro meu Ceará!


(Cantando) Vou voltar para o meu Ceará
Porque lá tenho nome
Aqui não sou nada, sou só Zé-com-fome
Sou só Pau-de-Arara, nem sei mais cantar
Vou picar minha mula
Vou antes que tudo rebente

All in all it was all just bricks in the wall.

""You! Yes, you behind the bikesheds, stand still lady!""

When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would
Hurt the children in any way they could
(oof!)
By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
And exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids
But in the town it was well known
When they got home at night, their fat and
Psychopathic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives.

We dont need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom

To fabricate great works
At once magnificent
And impossible...
On desert sands, from mountains of stone
A pyramid!
From flying buttresses alone
A wall of light!
A chapel ceiling
Screaming one man's ecstasy!
One man's ecstsasy...
Miracles them all!
China's endless wall...
Stonehenge, the Parthenon, the Duomo
The aqueducts of Rome
We did not attmept to make
With mammoth blocks of stone
A giant pyramid
No, not a pyramid...
Nor gothic walls that radiate with light...
Our task was to dream upon
And then create
A floating city!
Floating city...
A human metropolis...
A complete civilization!
Sleek!
And fast!

Tuba mirum spargens sonum
Per sepulchra regionum,
Coget omnes ante thronum

In quo totum continetur,
Unde mundus judicetur.

Donum fac remissionis ante diem rationis.

Et ab hoedis me sequestra, statuens in part dextra.

Um chapéu mais inteligente do que o papai aqui.

E dou de dez a zero em qualquer outro chapéu.

Não há nada escondido em sua cabeça
que o Chapéu Seletor não consiga ver,
por isso é só me porem na cabeça que vou dizer
em que casa de Hogwarts deverão ficar.

Quem sabe sua morada é a Grifinória,
casa onde habitam os corações indômitos.
Ousadia e sangue frio e nobreza
destacam os alunos da Grifinória dos demais;

Quem sabe é na Lufa-Lufa que você vai morar,
onde seus moradores são justos e leais
pacientes, sinceros, sem medo da dor;
ou será a velha e sábia Corvinal,

A casa dos que tem a mente sempre alerta,
onde os homens de grande espírito e saber
sempre encontrarão companheiros seus iguais;
ou quem sabe a Sonserina será a sua casa

E ali fará seus verdadeiros amigos,
homens de astúcia que usam quaisquer meios
para atingir os fins que antes colimaram.
Vamos, me experimentem! Não deverão temer!

Nem se atrapalhar! Estarão em boas mãos!

How they dance in the courtyard,
Sweet summer sweat.
Some dance to remember,
Some dance to forget

'please bring me my wine'

'we haven't had that spirit here
Since nineteen sixty nine'
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Wake you up in the middle of the night

Bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice

Of our own device'

They gathered for the feast
The stab it with their steely knives,

Que te operaram.
Não podes imaginar nem remotamente

Quando tinha 7 aninhos a qual não pude responder,
Decidi dar-te o presente mais bonito

Te dou de presente minha vida inteira
Sem nenhuma condição, para que faça com ela
O que queiras, viva filha, te amo com todo meu coração,
Quando ela chorou todo dia e toda noite.
No dia seguinte ela foi ao cemitério
E sentou-se ao lado do túmulo de seu pai,
Chorou tanto como ninguém poderia chorar e sussurrou:
Papai agora posso compreender o quanto me amavas,
Eu também te amava ainda que nunca tenha dito,
Agora compreendo a importância de dizer te amo,
Te amo, te amo!
E quero te pedir perdão por haver guardado silêncio
Tantas vezes.

Balançavam suavemente caíram
Algumas folhas e florzinhas e uma suave brisa
Roçou a face da menina que olhou para o céu
Tentou enxugar as lágrimas do seu rosto
Mas se levantou deu um sorriso sentiu o beijo de seu pai,
E naquele dia em diante saiu pelo mundo a fora,
Pra pedir a você que diga as pessoas
Eu te amo, para você que está chorando nesse momento,
Pra você que esteja emocionado,
Também possa dizer e abrir o seu coração.

I've seen him plow a field of corn all day.
That's reality.
His overalls are black with dirt, but his face is still full of dignity.
He talks about the waether, and he can tell you when it's gonna rain.
Told me 'bout the flood of twenty-nine that washed the crops away.

Chorus:
Underneath that Alabama sky, Grandpa told me 'bout the things he'd seen.
Underneath that Alabama sky, I listened to my Grandpa's memories.

At times he mentions Grandma, turn his head and wipe away a tear.
Sometimes we'd take her picture down and sit and pretend that she's still
here.
Three girls and two boys he raised on love and simple honesty.
And when they fin'lly have to carry him away, they'll take a lot of me.

And I guess I lost my way
There were oh so many roads

Never worried about paying or ever how much I owed

Moving eight miles a minute for months
At a time
Breaking all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searching
Searching for shelter again and again
Against the wind

A little something against the wind
I found myself seeking shelter against the wind

To cry my troubles away

In the town of broken dreams
The streets are filled with regret
Maybe down in Lonesome Town
I can learn to forget
Maybe down in Lonesome Town
I can learn to forget

/patsy-cline/,I Fall To Pieces,/patsy-cline/i-fall-to-pieces.html,"Written by Harlan Howard and Hank Cochran
(As recorded by Jim Reeves, November 21, 1961)

I fall to pieces
Each time I see you again
I fall to pieces
How can I be just your friend

You want me to act like we've never kissed
You want me to forget, pretend we've never met
And I've tried and I've tried but I haven't yet
You walk by, and I fall to pieces

I fall to pieces
Each time someone speaks your name
I fall to pieces
Time only adds to the flame

You tell me to find someone else to love
Someone who'll love me, too, the way you used to do
But each time I go out with someone new
You walk by and I fall to pieces

(I fall to pieces)
Each time someone speaks your name
(I fall to pieces)
Time only adds to the flame

You tell me to find someone else to love
Someone who'll love me too, the way you used to do
But each time I go out with someone new
You walk by and I fall to pieces

*Patsy Cline did not repeat the last two verses.

I hate to tell you this, but I'm very, very happy
And I know that's not what you'd expect from me at all
I'm not the kind to smile and bow out gracefully
I always wanted to take it to the wall

But I found somebody with a heart as big as Texas
I found an angel with the golden wings
She saw me down here in the dark somehow
And everything is different now

Yeah, I miss the old crowd sometimes
And the wild, wild nights of running
You know, a starving soul can't live like that for long
You go around in circles that just keep getting smaller
You wake up one morning and half your life is gone
I got so tired of that; I got so lonely
I dropped down and I called out to heaven
â€œSend me someone to love.â€
And heaven shot back, â€œYou get the love that you allow.â€
And everything is different now

Oh, and it's sweet to know
The wisdom that living brings
Since I got a telegram from the god of simple things
She said, â€œI don't care what you do for a living.â€
She said, â€œI don't care what kind of car you drive.â€
â€œAll I want to know right now is what do you believe in
And what it means to you to be alive
Will you stand here in this fire with me?
Are you ready for another life?â€
So I bit that bullet and I took that vow
And everything is different now
Everything is different now

Let's face it
I can't erase this

First thing's first while I still can't say

For me to express my tender feelings

It might be a little grade school
It might be a little uncool

the way you wear your clothes

I like like your raspy voice
I like like your hats of choice
I like that when I look into your eyes I see into your soul

I love -- I mean like like -- when you wrote
My name in the foggy cab window
I love -- I mean like like -- when we split those nachos
I usually hate being hugged
But when it comes to you I love
I mean I like like -- everything about those

Said, ""We've got the cure you've been searching for""

9. Get out on the dance floor with somebody

11. Let the bridges burn
12. Let go of the memory

But any misconception oughta stop before it starts
I'll be leaving in the morning, girl,
I break horses not hearts.

Your smile is so inviting and you're tender to a touch,

so when the sun comes up tomorrow, I'll be riding on instead.

But I'm stumbling in the dark
Like I'm ready for the worst
Hoping for a happy heart
'Cause I'm sure of what I want
But I don't know what I need
Put your hand in my hand and help me see
It's not just me

All I see are picture-perfect lies
There's nothing real about it but sometimes
What I choose to see is never good for me
Underneath, we're all just flesh and bones
Same old beach but throwing different stones
And I'd like to know I'm not on my own

And I know that I am trouble
And I think too many things
'Cause I'm tired of seeing double of everything

I'm just trying to keep on trying
But I'm stumbling in the dark
Like I'm ready for the worst
Hoping for a happy heart
'Cause I'm sure of what I want
But I don't know what I need
Put your hand in my hand and help me see

It's not just me who feels the world is on their shoulders
It's not just me who's out of place and don't belong
It's not just me who feels there's no way back
And this train is running straight off the track
Because I know, oh
'Cause I know, know

I'm just trying to keep on trying
But I'm stumbling in the dark
Like I'm ready for the worst
Hoping for a happy heart
'Cause I'm sure of what I want
But I don't know what I need
Put your hand in my hand and help me see
It's not just me
It's not just me
It's not just me",en

Shines like the stars in the sky
A breath of life in a well gone dry.
She picks me up but i feel it so low.
She's my sweet desert rose.

Ain't no money in our home town
And the mills have all shut down.
They say: there's work but it's always the next town.
Will you still love me when i'm gone.

Will you still love me when i'm gone
Though the empty night and the days so long.
I'm not the same and i guess that it shows
I missed my sweet desert rose.

I hear the wind blowing in the night.
Winter's come and it just ain't right.
This loneliness but it comes and it goes.

When thunder clouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve their names into those shining stars
He said go venture far beyond these shores
Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter where you are

Son, don't let it slip away

/boney-m/,Rasputin,/boney-m/rasputin.html,"Rasputin
There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the bible like a preacher
Full of ecstacy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire

RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on

He ruled the Russian land and never mind the czar
But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the queen he was no wheeler dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son

CHORUS

(Spoken:)
But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger
for power became known to more and more people,
the demands to do something about this outrageous
man became louder and louder.

""This man's just got to go!"" declared his enemies
But the ladies begged ""Don't you try to do it, please""
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms
Then one night some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
""Come to visit us"" they kept demanding
And he really came

RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
They put some poison into his wine
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and said ""I am fine""

RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
And so they shot him till he was dead

Só me resta agora atravessar

Podemos ir mais longe...

O que sou ninguém vai mudar
é deste jeito que vou levar
A vida passa não tem como controlar

Rebelde, chegou a minha vez

É sempre assim que deve ser
Meu coração vai ser rebelde para sempre!

Não tenho nada a perder.

Sem medo de arriscar
Agora vou até o fim

Podemos ir mais longe...

Amigo... é uma loucura
Tô vivendo uma aventura castigada pelo amor
Um labirinto sem saída
Onde o medo se converte em tanta dor
Vivo um triângulo

[Daddy Kall]
Amigo... a relação com a minha mina
Nunca foi espinho e flor
Mulher perfeita toda uma beleza meiga luz
Do Arpoador... e a minha vida tem cor (tem cor)

[Latino]
Amigo... ela só quer me encontrar escondida
alimentando
esse amor
Mesmo sabendo que no fundo
Tenha dono que eu quero ser seu protetor
Vivo um triângulo

Ela tem compromisso e você tem temor
Não desista amigo!

Amigo.... ela já sabia que era loucura toda essa
pegação
Mas é que a carne falou bem mais alto que a nossa
razão
Vivo um triângulo

É o que eu falei... se existe verdade
Esse sentimento tem que vencer
E o marido dela querendo ou não terá que entender
Alguém tem que perder

Qual é a parada?

Amigo de verdade conta tudo

Vou te dar uma idéia amigo foi mal
A minha atitude foi irracional
Instinto animal, fora da lei
Tanta tentação que eu não aguentei
O papo é reto eu não vou te enganar
Estou arrependido e não dá pra voltar
Amigo, perdão faça o que quiser,
Mas eu te confesso, eu peguei tua mulher...

[Daddy Kall]
O que?

[Latino]
Sai com a tua mulher;
Eu sai com a tua mulher;
Eu sai, sai, sai, sai, sai, sai...

[Daddy Kall]
Que Deus te perdoe, eu não vou perdoar
Em momento algum se pôs no meu lugar
Já vi que tudo era mentira quando ela me dizia
Que ia pra Maresias, viajar com sua amiga... me
enganou!
Você e ela numa cama... fazendo amor...
De Ilha Bela à Salvador
Quantos lençóis ela sujou?
Desprezou nós dois...

If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
And now every mother, can choose the colour
Of her child
That's not natures way
Well that's what they said yesterday
There's nothing left to do but pray
I think it's time I found a new religion
Waoh - it's so insane
To synthesize another strain
There's something in these
Futures that we have to be told

[Chorus]

Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh, there's nothing so bad,
As a man-made-man
I know yeah

Instrumental break

[Chorus]

Of this virtual insanity, we're livin' in,
Has got to change, yeah
Things, will never be the same,
And I can't go on
While we're livin' in oh,
oh virtual insanity
Oh, this world, has got to change
Cos I just, I just can't keep
going on, it was virtual,
Virtual insanity that we're livin' in,
that we're livin' in
That virtual insanity is what it is

Living - Virtual Insanity

I want you more than you'll ever know
So we'll just let it go
Don't be afraid to lose control, no

Tu me regardes toujours pas
Je te tourne, tourne, tourne autour
Mais tu ne me vois pas
Je parle pourtant la même langue
Je la défends à tour de bras
De Tokyo à Portland en passant par Barcelona

Je fais des efforts, j'explique bien
Je suis sûrement inadaptée
Quand je m'exporte, j'explique rien
J'ai pas besoin de m'expliquer
C'est peut-être là la vérité
Tu te poses beaucoup de questions
Ou peut-être, peut-être pas assez et c'est moi qui suis vraiment con

Je t'aime encore

On s'est connus sur un malentendu, on a aimé ça
À ce qu'il paraît ça dure trois ans, après, après c'est plus là
On s'habitue on se plaît mais c'est pas, c'est pas comme avant
T'as l'impression que j'ai changé, j'ai l'impression que t'as plus vingt ans
J'écris mon histoire ailleurs pour avoir des choses à te dire
Je te l'ai jamais dit d'ailleurs à quel point, quel point je t'admire
Tu t'enroules dans ce que tu sais comme dans couverture de survie
Elle est brillante, elle te plaît, mais pourquoi, pourquoi tu la suis

J'ai exploré les continents, on m'a donné ma liberté
La statue entre les dents, je ne l'ai, je ne l'ai pas volée
Demande à mes amours fidèles comme c'est bon de se retrouver
Je sais que je suis pas la plus belle mais je suis la sincérité",fr

But my heart can't take it

But all the while, I can't face it
Why do I miss you so much?
I wanna stop this hurt inside
Oh baby please
give us one more try

Laughin' it up as you pretend
To have a good time, (good time)

So one of us has got to say
We can't keep living this same way
So I'll be the one

We were meant to be
Together so whatever it takes (Baby Come Back)
Baby come back to me
I should have never set you free
love baby
Come back (Baby Come Back)

I wanna call, but then I stall
Cause after all, I just couldn't take it
Cause if your play was to push me away
You know that day
my heart you'd break it (Baby Come Back)
I know we made a mistake, (I do)
Can't you stop your foolish pride (Oh no)
And come back to me
Let's try, Let's try, Let's try, Let's try it again

Baby Come back to me (Come Back)
In my heart I still believe
We were meant to be
Together so whatever it takes (Baby Come Back)

I should have never set you free
My baby
Come back (Baby Come Back)

You know you miss your baby V
And I can see that you think about me
So why do you act like you don't care
Like all this love between us isn't there
I know that you're upset
I know I did you wrong
I know you want me to pay for all the pain I've caused
But in the end it all comes down to just one thing
It's you and me
So I sing

Baby Come Back!

/noel/,Change,/noel/change.html,"People sometimes feel that their lives aren´t real, it´s a film they´re seeing.
Sometimes fantasize of a better life that they could be living.
No one lends a hand, it´s all part of a plan that demands you give out.
It makes you fantasize, you decide to pack and leave it all behind.

Chorus:
And if I had my way, I´d changed my life today,
and if things were to change it´s all the same.
It´s only right by far we must like what we are.
I really find no need to live in dreams.

Take it in your stride to determine why you decide to not be you.
No one can take charge of the man you are, what you do is up to you.
And when the pressure´s on, just relax and smile, then think of what to do.
""No, I can´t"" is not the attitude to take",en

Where I was all alone walking on the street
My carillon and me
Were two inseparable strange melodics

Nobody was around
The silence and the gloom werw so profound
I started to explore
But you were the only one I was looking for

I've never had a dream
Where I was singing that strange melody
My carillon and me
Were dancing on the world for eternity

Now that I am awake
I still feeling the call that I won't forsake
It's an elusive love
That you contain into seven strange notes

I am a carillonneur and I play the carillon

rubò sei cervi nel parco del Re
vendendoli per denaro

Sellate il suo cavallo dalla bianca criniera
sellatele il suo pony
cavalcherà fino a Londra stasera
ad implorare per Geordie

Geordie non rubò mai neppure per me
un frutto o un fiore raro
rubò sei cervi nel parco del Re

Salvate le sue labbra, salvate il suo sorriso
non ha vent'anni ancora
cadrà l'inverno anche sopra il suo viso

I throw myself a party
Chardonnay and Oxy
I stopped the scream inside my head
I remember when you had me
Floating high like Sid & Nancy

They say it's not the answer but I can't carry on
Cause I got nowhere, no one
Without you boy I'm done
And when I'm gone, remember you're the one
And just because I fight
Don't mean that I never learned how to love

You know devils don't fly
So don't expect me not to fall
Devils don't fly (fly, fly fly)
But God we almost had it all
But I got chains and you got wings
You know that life ain't fair sometimes
Devils don't fly, fly, fly
But I try

What's a girl to do when she's not strong
When everyone that holds my hand
Gets cut from all the thorns
I used to put my ear against the wall
To hear the screams, to hear the fall
More reasons to escape it all

And it's not the answer but I can carry on
I give my best smile, my last dime
But I'm always getting wrong
It's not 'cause I'm young or from a broken home
Maybe I'm just fight, 'cause I don't know where I belong

You know devils don't fly
So don't expect me not to fall
Devils don't fly (fly, fly fly)
Thank God we almost had it all
But I got chains and you got wings
You know that life ain't fair sometimes
Devils don't fly, fly, fly
But I try

Angels were never meant to fall
And you were the loveliest of all
If I thought God could fix it
I pray for your forgiveness
But I've been cast out thrown out
When I crossed to the other side

No devils don't fly!

You know devils don't fly
So don't expect me not to fall

Put your head in your hands,
Take a sip of your life so you can think
About your future and dreams, keep up the fantasy

We've come a long way from where we began
This is crazy after all these years
I'm on your magical mystery ride
We've come too far

Can we go back to the stars?

Time flies like nothing changed at all?

Tell me that you've had enough

Faço deles a minha filosofia e faço deles a minha ação
Viva, creia, ame e faça, essa também é minha oração

Viva sua filosofia, ame a sua arte
creia na sua religião e faça a sua parte
Mas não use sua religião pra tentar reprimir o outro
Somos sete bilhões de mentes no mundo
E querer que todo mundo acredite na mesma coisa
é, no mínimo, papo de louco

Eu respeito todos que tem fé
eu respeito todos que não a tem
Eu respeito quem crê em um Deus
eu respeito quem não crê em ninguém
Eu gosto de quem tem fé no universo
eu gosto de quem tem fé em si mesmo
Eu gosto de quem tem fé no verso
e eu gosto dos que andam a esmo

Um abraço pra quem é da ciência
um abraço pra quem é de Deus
Um abraço pra quem é da arte
e um abraço pra quem é ateu

Axé pra quem é de axé, amém pra quem é de amém
Blessed be pra quem é de magia e amor
pra quem é do bem

Religião vem do latim religare que significa união
Então pare de dividir o mundo
entre os que vão e os que não vão para o paraíso

O nosso mundo tá doente em tudo
Enquanto nós perdemos tempo brigando por isso
Ao invés de dividir as religiões
entre as que são do mal e as que são do bem
Que tal botar sua ideologia no bolso
E ajudar aquele moço que de frio
morre na rua desamparado e sem ninguém?

Is where I search for the light,
Pick up my pen and start to write,
I struggle a fight,
Dark forces in the clear moonlight without fear,
Insomnia.

I can't get no sleep.

I used to worry,
Thought I was going mad in a hurry,
Getting stressed, making excess
mess in darkness. No electricity,
Something's all over me, greasy.
Insomnia please release me,
And let me dream of making mad love to my girl on the heath,
Tearing off tights with my teeth.
But there's no release, no peace,
I toss and turn without cease.
Like a curse,
I open my eyes and rise like yeast.

At least,
A couple of weeks since I last slept.
Kept taking sleepers,
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still,
The night, I write by candle light,
I find in sight
Fundamental movement.

So when it's black
This insomniac
Take an original tack
Keep the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack.

Left the Hotpoints to rust in the kitchenettes
And they're saving their labour for insane reading.


Some of them lose - and some of them lose
But that's what they want - and that's what they choose
It's a burden - such a burden

So malicious.

She takes me places where it?s hard to breathe in (harder to breathe in),

No way you?re stopping cause she?ll shoot you down.

Won?t cover the wound she?ll let the love bleed out.

We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

I could put on the back of a postcard
No song that I could sing
but I can try for your heart
Our dreams and they are made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs
with sepia-toned loving
Love is the answer at least
for most of the questions in my heart
Why are we here? And where do we go?
And how come it's so hard?
It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing,
it's always better when we're together

It's always better when we're together
Yeah we'll look at the stars
when we're together
Well it's always better when we're together
Yeah!! it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments
just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
when the morning light sings
Or brings new things for tomorrow night you see
That they'll be gone too,
too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way
into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression I was somewhere in between
With only two, just me and you,
not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
we'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Yeah it's always better when we're together
We're somewhere in between together
Well it's always better when we're together
Yeah it's always better when we're together

I believe in memories
they look so pretty when I sleep
And when I wake up
you look so pretty sleeping next to me
But there is not enough time
And there is no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better together",en

Were the best things you ever had

So happy hearted in the warmth
Rang true inside these bones

Just to bless the morning

You were pretty

Well I'll be damned
Here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you happened to call
And here I sit
Hand on the telephone
Hearing a voice I'd known
A couple of light years ago
Heading straight for a fall

As I remember your eyes
Were bluer than robin's eggs
My poetry was lousy you said
Where are you calling from?
A booth in the midwest
Ten years ago
I bought you some cufflinks
You brought me something
We both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust

Well you burst on the scene
Already a legend
The unwashed phenomenon
The original vagabond
You strayed into my arms
And there you stayed
Temporarily lost at sea
The Madonna was yours for free
Yes the girl on the half-shell
Would keep you unharmed

Now I see you standing
With brown leaves falling around
And snow in your hair
Now you're smiling out the window
Of that crummy hotel
Over Washington Square
Our breath comes out white clouds
Mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me
We both could have died then and there

Now you're telling me
You're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You who are so good with words
And at keeping things vague
Because I need some of that vagueness now
It's all come back too clearly
Yes I loved you dearly
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
I've already paid

We’ll face the winds that break the strongest of trees
Beckon for the sweet soft summer breeze

They got broken wings
Never will you hear them asking why the caged bird sings
All my friends
They know how to live
Oh, so much sorrow and so much love to give

We’ll face the winds that break the strongest of trees

Every body wants to know which way to go
I see the crowds a running

/dubliners/,The Rocky Road To Dublin,/dubliners/the-rocky-road-to-dublin.html,"Well in the merry month of May now from me home I started,
Left the girls of Tuam nearly broken hearted,
Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother,
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother,
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born,
Cut a stout black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins;
Brand a pair of brogues rattling o'er the bogs
And fright'ning all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary,
Started by daylight next morning blithe and early,
Took a drop of pure to keep me heartfrom sinking;
Thats a Paddy's cure whenever he's on drinking.
To hear the lassies smile, laughing all the while
At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a bubblin'
Asked me was I hired, wages I required,
I was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity
To be soon deprived a view of that fine city.
So then I took a stroll, all among the quality;
Me bundle it was stole, in a near locality.
Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind,
No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin'
Enquiring after the rogue, they said me Connaught brogue
Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

From there I got away, me spirits never falling,
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing.
The Captain at me roared, said that no room had he;
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy.
Down among the pigs, did some hearty rigs,
Played some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling;
When off Holyhead wished meself was dead,
Or better for instead on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed,
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it.
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing;
Poor old Erin's Isle they began abusing.
""Hurrah me soul"" says I, me Shillelagh I let fly.
Some Galway nearby, they saw I was a-hobblin,
With a load ""hurray !"" They joined in the affray.
Quickly cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down
the rocky road and all the way to Dublin,
Whack follol de rah !",en

'Til the day is done, remember.

Skinny dip, skinny dip, skinny dip, skinny dip.
Skinny dipping around the scene,
Way down by the river,
Sunshine's better on the other side.

Better than this side, you know.
The sunshine's better over there, better over there, better over there.

If I tell you that I love you, would you take all my money.
We could run naked, naked through the fire;
Through the water, through the ice, through the sun,
Through the jungle, through the desert sands.
On the road, down and around the swings, roundabouts.

Sunshine's better on the other side,
Sunshine's better than you've ever seen before in your life.

Upon my anxious wonderings

Across the vast and harvest plains

To tell of triumph or of pain
No word far off battle's cry
To draw me out or draw me nigh

And gather in the patient fruits
And after autumns blaze and burn
I'll know the full still, deep roots
That nothing seem to know or need

That crack the ice in frozen ponds
And slumbering in winter's folds
Have dreams of green and blue and gold
I'll learn to love the fallow way

Of my own heart once more in spring

Brincar com o meu sentimentos (2x)

Momento, isso é certo
Sair de um grande amor não legal pra qualquer um que ama e queira está perto
Eu abri mão de tanta coisa por você
Só me querer mas não deu
E mesmo assim se alguém me perguntar vou dizer
Que valeu.

Tudo que quer ele come
Mas o pobre que trabalha
Ganha pouco e passa fome

Rico come caviar, come picanha, filé
Na vida o rico tem tudo
E come tudo que quer
Onde o rico bota o dedo o pobre não bota o pé

O pobre come bolacha, tripa de porco e sardinha
Farofa de jerimum, bucho de boi com farinha
Come cuscuz com manteiga
E batata com passarinha

O rico é quem come tudo
Tudo que quer ele come
Mas o pobre que trabalha
Ganha pouco e passa fome

O rico leva a família para o salão de beleza
Manda cortar o cabelo
E na pele faz limpeza
E a filha volta tão linda que parece uma princesa

O pobre leva a família num salão barato e fraco
Manda raspar a cabeça
E o cabelo do sovaco
E o filho fica igualmente um filhote de macaco

O rico é quem come tudo
Tudo que quer ele come
Mas o pobre que trabalha
Ganha pouco e passa fome

O rico quando adoece
Vai pro melhor hospital
No outro dia seu nome sai na pagina do jornal
Dizendo que o danado já não ta passando mal

E o pobre quando adoece é feliz quando ele escapa
E quando ta internado a comida é pão e papa
Se gemer muito de noite
O café que vem é tapa

O rico é quem come tudo
Tudo que quer ele come
Mas o pobre que trabalha
Ganha pouco e passa fome

O filho do homem rico tem uma vida bacana
Seu papai paga os estudos
E no final de semana
Ele sai com sua gata pra passear de santana

O filho do homem pobre vai passear de jumento
Bota a nega na garupa, sai correndo contra o vento
Quando o jegue dá um pulo
Bota a bunda no cimento

O rico é quem come tudo
Tudo que quer ele come
Mas o pobre que trabalha
Ganha pouco e passa fome

A mulher do homem rico
se vai pra maternidade
Dá a luz de um menino falo com sinceridade
Ganha milhões de presente da alta sociedade

A mulher do homem pobre
Quando ela vai descansar
O presente que ela ganha é bolacha e guaraná
E uma bala de chupeta que é pra o guri chupar

O rico é quem come tudo
Tudo que quer ele come
Mas o pobre que trabalha
Ganha pouco e passa fome

A mulher do rico sai num sapato bom de couro
Cabelo bem penteado, brinco que vale um tesouro
Pulseira e colar de prata
Relógio e cordão de ouro

A mulher do pobrezinho
Só anda sem gabarito
O cabelo é assanhado o casaco é esquisito
E a saia tem mais buraco que tábua de pirulito

O rico é quem come tudo
Tudo que quer ele come
Mas o pobre que trabalha
Ganha pouco e passa fome

Filha de rico se forma pra trabalhar em cartório
Gabinete especial, telefone e escritório
Engenheira e medicina
Exame e laboratório

A filha do pobrezinho fica velha sem leitura
Quando aparece um emprego
É na rua da amargura
Pra jogar tambor de lixo no carro da prefeitura

O rico é quem come tudo
Tudo que quer ele come
Mas o pobre que trabalha
Ganha pouco e passa fome

O filho do homem rico só toma banho no chuveiro
Uma caixa de sabonete, dois, três perfume estrangeiro
Cada banho é uma roupa
E cada perfuma é um cheiro

O filho do pobrezinho só se molha no açude
Não pode ver empregada
Que ele esfrega e lhe ajuda
E os pescoço e as costelas têm quase um baú de grude

O rico é quem come tudo
Tudo que quer ele come
Mas o pobre que trabalha
Ganha pouco e passa fome

A filha do homem rico se arranja um namorado
Ele vai pra casa dela
Num carro novo zerado
Pois é filha de doutor, de prefeito ou deputado

A filha do pobrezinho quando arranja um mané
Ela diz meu pai é rico
E o povo sabe quem é
É um que vende pipoca na porta do cabaré


O rico é quem come tudo
Tudo que quer ele come
Mas o pobre que trabalha
Ganha pouco e passa fome

A filha do rico vai fazer curso no Japão
Na Grécia na Argentina até Afeganistão
Porque a filha de rico só viaja de avião

A filha do pobrezinho no interior grosseiro
Passa quatro cinco dias olhando um livro primeiro
Engasgada na fumaça
No farol do candeeiro

O rico é quem come tudo
Tudo que quer ele come
Mas o pobre que trabalha
Ganha pouco e passa

Nesse forró é que eu me espalho
Ficar sozinho não sei como é
To sempre agarrado no cangote da mulher

Já faz um tempo que aconteceu
Foi na cidade de sacramento
Que este fato ocorreu

É uma pequena cidade
Que fica lá no sertão
Terra de moça bonita
Terra de homem machão

Foi até que um belo dia
Apareceu um forasteiro
Chegou de manhã cedinho
E ficou o dia inteiro
Pegou livro e viola
Instalou-se no terreiro

Começou a prosear, cantar, falar poesia
Era magrelo esse caboclo
Mas era cheio de alegria
As mulheres do lugar
Vieram ouvir o que ele dizia

Ele falava de amor
Ele falava de paixão
Mulheres são como flor
Merecem amor no coração
Sempre tratadas com respeito, carinho e dedicação

Espantadas com aquilo
Ouvindo o que nunca ouviam
As mulheres de sacramento
Se encheram de alegria
Esse moço é diferente
É tudo que a gente queria

E começou a confusão
Com essas moças ouriçadas
Ficaram todas felizes
Estão todas apaixonadas
""Casa comigo"" pra cá
""Casa comigo"" pra lá
E do pobre forasteiro
Todas queriam se enamorar

Mas que azar ele deu
Em cometer tal heresia
Escolheu a cidade errada
Pra declamar sua poesia

Os homens ficaram bravo
E começaram a bater o pé
Esse cabra safado
Quer roubar nossas muié

""Mas não vamos deixar barato
Isso não fica como está
Você vai ver cabra da peste
A gente vai te matar""

E foi aquela confusão
Corre, corre, bafafá
O forasteiro deu um grito
""Pare tudo que eu quero falar""

""O que eu fiz minha gente
Não foi crime não
Só falei de poesia
Paz e amor no coração
Não é justo que me matem
Nem me levem pra prisão""

""Eu não tinha intenção de roubar suas muié
A dona do meu coração
É Maria Salomé""

""Pra vocês que são cabra macho
Uma coisa eu vou falar
Não é falta de macheza
Homem saber amar
Pois a mulher que tem carinho
Tem carinho para dar""

""A última coisa que eu digo
Pra essa prosa finalizar
Homem nenhum morre feliz
Sem saber o que é amar""

Feliz da vida, de missão cumprida
Nosso forasteiro, o poeta Zé Tomé
Pegou seus livros e sua viola
E foi encontrar sua Salomé

Depois desse acontecido
Os homens ficaram espertos
Tratando as moças com carinho
As coisas começaram a dar certo

Janice já tinha desistido
Mas deu uma chance pro Alfredo
Junto com amor veio o perdão
E Ana perdoou Pedro

Sebastiana e Ancelmo
Formaram um lindo par
Com tanto amor nessa cidade
Todos queriam se casar

Dorotéia está muito feliz
Entendeu-se com Juvenal
Camilo voltou pra Tereza
E Lucinha pro Nicolau

Ronaldo Werneck, o mais bravo de todos

When Curtis Jackson was yet to crawl
He had a photo of a Gran Torino
From Ohio on the wall

He got deeper into the sound
When the big debate was Watergate
Marlena and Roberta
Made him feel like makin' love

He remembers
The boogie brought down the house
The DJ's turnin' out, 1975
His surrender was total and complete
Down to his dancin' feet
And he gave it up for love

He gave it up for love

Santana played with the winds on fire
And the way of the world became his heart desire
He met a girl freckles on her face
They found﻿ a place for the summer
This was a time of space and rhapsody
His hair was long Lord knows the sound was funky
Herbie and Stevie held the keys to his fantasies

Wasn't gravity that kept him there?

Abusei de droga, não preciso de aviso
Tanto álcool no meu corpo que já não me sinto vivo
O meu pulso cortado com meu sangue escorrendo
Eu vi meu corpo morto, só que eu não senti medo

Você me diz para mudar, só penso em me matar
Você não quer me ajudar, só pensa em me julgar

Afundando na solidão, procuro meu coração

Sou a voz dos cativos, dos negros, dos oprimidos
Sou povo esquecido, desprezado e abandonado
Sou grito do gueto, sou o pai desempregado
Por que tanta desigualdade existe nesse mundo?
Mãe prometo que vou dar uma house pra senhora
Menores que fizeram promessa e foram embora
Deixando o gueto, eternizando nossa história

Há uma esperança sim, que Deus irá ouvir
Sou mais um menor que no gueto se destacou
Mais um diamante que meus olhos ofuscou
Há uma esperança sim, que Deus irá ouvir
Sou mais um menor que no gueto se destacou
Mais um diamante que meus olhos ofuscou

Eles falam: Preto não, e não provam o contrário
Se incomoda pelo fato de ser favelado
Armado com o mike na mão headshot no estado
Dizem mais um filho da puta, só que esse é raro
Eu não parei, não desanimei
Com Deus eu me apeguei
Eu lutei e cheguei
Só pra mostrar que a favela tá por todo lado
Vai ter que aturar, na voz sou mais um preto raro

Há uma esperança que não me fez desistir
Eu tenho fé, eu sei que posso mais
Bato no peito eu sei que sou capaz
Há uma esperança que não me fez desistir
Eu tenho fé, eu sei que posso mais
Bato no peito eu sei que sou capaz

Sou a voz do povo e dos menorzão
Que já tão cansado dessa opressão
Mas independente de tudo nós é união
Nem tudo que nós fala sobre aqui é ficção
É que na favela é diferente
Só quem vem de lá dentro entende
Só por ser neguinho, favelado
Muitos deles vão querer pisar na gente

Há uma esperança que, eles vão conseguir
Tenho fé em toda molecada da quebrada
Que um dia eles vai passar de multistrada
Peço pra Deus me ouvir, sei que ele está por mim
Tá por toda minha rapaziada
Essa é minha oração cantada

Vim pra mostrar o contrário
A manipulação do estado
E a revolta de um favelado
Que não pode andar com o vidro baixo que já é parado
Se isso não é preconceito, me prova o contrário
Olha pras comunidade
Desde sempre excluída da sociedade
Governo covarde, não faz nada e quando faz é fraude
Já é tarde

Há uma esperança sim, que Deus irá ouvir
A voz dos menorzinho da quebrada
Que muita das vezes só quer dar risada
Há uma esperança sim, que Deus irá ouvir
A voz dos menorzinho da quebrada
Que pra ser feliz vai ter a multistrada

Olha lá, mais um menorzinho abandonado pelo pai
Mais uma criança sendo abortada
E nesse momento na rua de trás
Mais uma mulher tá sendo abusada
Falam que vai melhorar, tapando o Sol com a peneira
No mundo quem manda é o sistema
Nem tudo é o que você pensa

Há uma esperança aqui, mas ela se escondeu
Eles roubam demais, reclamam demais
Homens pedem paz, querendo guerra com Deus
Há uma esperança aqui, mas ela se escondeu
Com medo da morte, última que morre
Chegou o final do tempo e ninguém percebeu",pt

Mas eu acho que isso
Não é a solução.

Nunca deixarei de te amar

Com uma Meca de teto solar, eu tô indo buscar

Era só mais um Silva que a estrela não brilha
Ele era funkeiro, mas era pai de família
É só mais um Silva que a estrela não brilha
Ele era funkeiro, mas era pai de família

Era um domingo de Sol, ele saiu de manhã
Pra jogar seu futebol, deu uma rosa pra irmã
Deu o beijo das crianças, prometeu não demorar
Falou pra sua esposa que ia vir pra almoçar

Mas era só mais um Silva que a estrela não brilha
Ele era funkeiro, mas era pai de família
É só mais um Silva que a estrela não brilha
Ele era funkeiro, mas era pai de família

Era trabalhador, pegava o trem lotado
Tinha boa vizinhança, era considerado
E todo mundo dizia que era um cara maneiro
Outros o criticavam porque ele era funkeiro
O funk não é modismo, é uma necessidade
É pra calar os gemidos que existem nessa cidade

Todo mundo devia nessa história se ligar
Porque tem muito amigo que vai pro baile dançar
Esquecer os atritos, deixar a briga pra lá
E entender o sentido quando o Dj detonar

E era só mais um Silva que a estrela não brilha
Ele era funkeiro, mas era pai de família
É só mais um Silva que a estrela não brilha
Ele era funkeiro, mas era pai de família

E anoitecia, ele se preparava
É pra curtir o seu baile que, em suas veias, rolava
Foi com a melhor camisa, tênis que comprou, suado
E, bem antes da hora, ele já estava arrumado
Se reuniu com a galera, pegou o bonde lotado
Os seus olhos brilhavam, ele estava animado
Sua alegria era tanta ao ver que tinha chegado
Foi o primeiro a descer e, por alguns, foi saudado

Mas, naquela triste esquina, um sujeito apareceu
Com a cara amarrada, suando, estava um breu
Carregava um ferro em uma de suas mãos
Apertou o gatilho, sem dar qualquer explicação
E o pobre do nosso amigo, que foi pro baile curtir
Hoje, com sua familia, ele não irá dormir

Porque era só mais um Silva que a estrela não brilha
Ele era funkeiro, mas era pai de família
É só mais um Silva que a estrela não brilha
Ele era funkeiro, mas era pai de família
Era só mais um Silva que a estrela não brilha
Ele era funkeiro, mas era pai de família
Só mais um Silva que a estrela não brilha

Quem desacreditou ontem hoje viu e percebeu.
Correria é assim mesmo,
Um dia vai, o outro vem e a inveja que nos cerca,
Nos fortalece também.

Não quero ser julgado, por isso eu não julgo,
Eu quero o sossego, mas não nego um tumulto.
Não se esqueça das coisas que não tem volta na vida,
como a flecha mal lançada, ou a palavra mal dita.
Maldito é aquele que vem pra diminuir,
Quando o certo é somar, multiplicar pra dividir.

A caminhada da vida se conquista de passo em passo,
E a ladeira que leva pra cima, pode te levar pra baixo.
Entao, tu vê legal, entende o papo primeiro,
Gosta de contar história,
eu gosto é de contar dinheiro.

Apenas mais um que leva a vida desse jeito,
Sorriso no rosto e pureza dentro do peito,
É eu por tu, tu por ele no final nós por nós,
Só os papo de futuro, sem desperdício de voz.

Porque quem veio do pouco, não se ilude com muito,
Age conforme o certo, é sempre o melhor intuito,
Eu já entendi muito bem a força que tem o mal,
Mas o que vem contra nós, filtramos só com a moral.
Quem pode, pode, quem não pode vai ficar querendo,
O poder pode ser dado só pra quem está podendo.

De caô, de inveja, falsidade, covardia,
Judaria, simpatia não vai me derrubar,
Por que só quem me criou que pode me cobrar.

Vem mais dois na retaguarda mas tão de crok na mão.

Lá vem dois irmãozinhos,de 762
Dando tiro pro alto só pra fazer teste

Aqueles são bandidos ruim e ninguém trabalha
De Ak47 na outra mão a metralha
Esse rap é maneiro eu digo pra vocês
Quem é aqueles caras de M16

Nas entradas da favela já tem ponto 50
E Se tu tomar um ""Pá"" será que você grita?
Seja de ponto 50 ou então de ponto 30

Uns até bateu joelho no chão

Se der ruim nós vai parar na prisão

Abre a mente e esquece o coração

A frieza toma conta do ar
Porque chegou a hora de enquadrar
Atenção redobrada no lugar
Se alguém reagir tem que atirar

Felizmente não ferimos ninguém
Invadimos a mente do refém
Na fuga o piloto disse amém
Dessa vez nosso bonde se deu bem

E no Rio o dinheiro vai ficar

E o carro já mandamos queimar

Só pra tu sentir o ronco do motor
Escuto, muita calma maluco agore vê se não se assusta
Apenas a demonstração da vida bandida do mestre das fugas
Que pilota não pensa duas vezes
Não conta com a sorte, nois conta com Deus
A voz de terror já foi dada se tu reagir o problema é so teu
Nois não se intimidaa com nada

O segredo de tudo é manter a calma
Não descontrole o decontrolado
Se não é capaz de sugar sua alma
Minha paciência esgotou
Pra tudo na vida á um limite
Se concentre nas minhas idéias
Escute a real, não é cena de filme
Ô porque na primeira sessão
Tu vai ver que o piloto de tudo é capaz
Vacilou tu vai ser torturado
Bem pior do que o os Jogos Mortais
Tu acha que tu pode mais

Quer bater de frente com todos nós
Mas quando tudo descontrola
O comédia rebola e muda de voz
E depois que o vacilo foi feito
Não adianta vir se redimir
Avisei na 1ª, na 2ª, na 3ª vai ter que subir
Não tem ""boi"", não tem ""pá""avisei várias vezes
depois que subiu Sangue bom só lamento

Depois que torramo serviu de exemplo
Logo depois de corrigir o errado
Mostrei essa letra pra vários irmãos
Os caras falou ""vai logo no estúdio e Kauan, explode com esse refrão""

E quando passa pra quarta vish, fuga dos gambé

Que quando nois passa, nois passa à mil

Ta ligado que nesse assunto o piloto de fuga passa batido
Nos pegar, os vermes tentaram tentaram tentaram e logo desistiram
Mais eles logo insistiram e chamaram o reforço através do radinho
Mais eu vou falar uma coisa é melhor vocêis sairem do meu caminho
Seja gol, seja astra, a rocam ou seja blazer
No estado de São Paulo pra nois o sinal é verde
Então escuta que é o seguinte 19 não é 20

O que não falta pe apetite, é pique need for speed
Não importa o que tu acha se eu sou louco ou sou normal
O importante disso tudo é que o som é original
Minhas rimas eu que trabalho, nelas eu sempre caprichei
Pra depois não vir fulano

Com a luz do céu e o sol brilhando de verdade
A sensação que eu tive foi de liberdade
Bateu revolta, saudade e a dor no peito
Lembrei dos manos que estão lá no sofrimento

de mili dias
os braços fortes
Que com nós representava
Os vida loka no peão pela quebrada
Todos sabiam que o perigo era dobrado
Era os coringas pronto pro time formado

Nós na quebrada é paz, lazer, cultura e coletividade
No nosso lado é só os fiel sem falsidade
De qualidade os moleque é diretoria
é nós por nós
E a família é unida

E nós nas pistas
155 no 12 ou no 157
ia bolado treinado desde pivete
na inteligencia buscando os objetivos
na consciência que era profissão perigo

Você saiu lá da sua casa
sentindo aquele aperto
Quase ciente que viria o desacerto
Mas os coringas não desistem é jamais
enfrenta a morte e não podem voltar atrás

E na quebrada
Quando a noticia chegou aos nossos ouvidos
O bonde todo os manos e as minas todos
entristecidos
Os bota preta
prenderam meus irmãozinhos
Levaram o Itálo e o meu mano tonzinho

Tranquilidade que a melhora logo menos vai chegar
Sei que é difícil conviver nesse lugar
A liberdade eu desejo de coração
pra todos CDP e pra todos fundão

Hó Deus olha os parceiros que estão do outro lado
Pois só mente por ti que eles podem ser julgados
Sei como se sente quando vê a ave voar
Mas fica tranquilinha que a liberdade
vai cantar

Hó Deus olha os parceiros que estão do outro lado
Pois só mente por ti que eles podem ser julgados
Pois sei como se sente quando vê a ave voar

Hoje eu lembrei
vários progressos conquistados não sozinho
Porque na cena tava eu e o Léozinho
mente a milhão cada um foi para um lado
infelizmente hoje o Léo está trancado

Da mesma forma foi com o Magno
e também foi com o Nê
A fá do singa e o Rafinha Bebê
Pitero Roni também estão no sofrimento
Já ca Paçoca Marcola o Rom e o Neno

Entrou no crime não de chapéu
Pois já sabia as consequências
Troca de tiro ou enfrentar a penitencia

Deu no que deu
não adianta lamentar
A paciência é a chave ai desse lugar
Nóis é treinado
desenrola e tira de letra no talento
Sai de atacante se esquivando do tormento
mas aqui fora só nos resta aguardar
na melhor hora vai sair desse lugar

Oh Deus olha os parceiros que estão do outro lado
Pois só mente por ti que eles podem ser julgados
Sei como se sente quando vê a ave voar
Mas fica tranquilinha a liberdade
vai cantar

Oh Deus olha os parceiros que estão do outro lado
Pois só mente por ti que eles podem ser julgados
Sei como se sente quando vê a ave voar
Mas fica tranquilinha a liberdade
vai cantar

Hoje eu pensei como se sente tando ai do outro lado
Muita revolta, triste um louco solitário
Mas seja forte não se entregue a depressão
Você tá preso mas tu não tá morto não

Final de ano
Sei que é difícil passar longe da família
Seu pai sua mãe irmão sobrinho e filha
Sai um por um tô no aguarde pode pá
que a comunidade inteira vai festejar

Hó Deus olha os parceiros que estão do outro lado
Pois só mente por ti que eles podem ser julgados
Eu Sei como se sente quando vê a ave voar
fica tranquilinha a liberdade
vai cantar

A liberdade vai cantar
A liberdade vai cantar
Eu tenho fé
Eu tenho é fé

A liberdade jamais será dada pelo opressor
Mas sim conquistada pelo oprimido
Nenhuma condenação há
a quem ca em Cristo Jesus
Só Deus pode me julgar",pt

Que tudo que sobe desce
Ela fingi entender que
O que nasce vai morrer.

Não cai de para-quedas.

Mais dolorosa é a queda.

Nada me faltará e sempre me guardar.
Por onde eu andar, não me deixa cair.
E se o dia for triste, faça ele sorrir.

E se o tempo fechou, faça nascer o sol.
Menino brilha muito, jogando seu futebol.
Eu sei, que a vida não é fácil não.
Me desculpe mãe, por essa contra mão.

Pedi perdão ao pai, mas ainda estou bem,
Pois nessa escola da vida sempre sonhei em ser alguém.
Dificuldade pra mim nunca me diminuiu.
E assim eu sigo, por todo esse Brasil.

Quem não gosta de mim, com certeza não faz falta,
O trem passa por cima se tentar pôr na mancada.
O covarde vive muito nesse mundo louco.
Mas, eu prefiro morrer, pra nascer de novo.

Sem limites, eu sempre fui um moleque sem limites.
Acostumado a viver no crime,e sem ter hora pra voltar.
Sem limites, eu sempre fui um moleque sem limites.
Acostumado a viver no regime, e sem ter hora pra voltar(2x)

São Jorge protetor, tem sempre meu valor.
Eu tatuei em mim, pra nunca sentir dor.
Pai de revoluções, quem crê diga amém.
E se ele lutou, eu vou lutar também.

Vou fazer rico beijar, o pé de quem é pobre.
E quem é pobre subir, mas nunca ser esnobe.
Eu imagino um vendedor de picolé de praia,
Tendo de tudo que há de luxo dentro da sua casa.

Quem crê diga amém sempre pro nosso bem,
O mundo que nós vivemos é o mesmo do além
Não desiste não tu sabe como é que é essas palavras
É do grande chico xavier.

Sem limites, eu sempre fui um moleque sem limites.
Acostumado a viver no regime, e sem ter hora pra voltar.

Acaba com o ser humano

Boa nova no amor proclamar
No diálogo com a cultura
Para a vida florir, fecundar

Quando o anseio do conhecimento
Ultrapassa barreiras, fronteiras
Se destaca o ensinamento
Oriundo da fé verdadeira
Que nos faz nesta ação solidários
Para o bem, condição que é certeira

E quem fala com sabedoria
É aquele que ensina com amor

É pra nós luz, caminho, vigor

Educar é atitude sublime
Que prepara a vida futura
Compreendendo o presente, pensamos
Ensinar é proposta segura
Para, enfim, destacar-se a atitude

Traz em nós o sentido discreto
Na harmonia com os seres viventes

Para o mundo poder imitar

Escutar, meditar, compreender

O evangelho seguir e viver

Arrancando do meu peito uma dor

As cenas lindas que o tempo já notou
Você é minha tempestade do bem
Trazendo chuva ao meu deserto
Me fazendo alguém
Amada simplesmente pelo que é
Ontem namorada, noiva, e agora sua mulher

Vamos nos molhar na chuva do Senhor
Alimentar com bênçãos o nosso amor
Fazer valer a pena tudo que a gente conquistou
Vamos juntos fazer um culto de agradecimento a Deus
Quando mais precisei você me apareceu
Um presente e o remetente era Deus
Me sinto tão amada, isso faz bem

Grande vai ser a escolha os covardes e medrosos
Do caminho irão voltar
Junta o povo Gideão, Eu vou marcar a tua história
Te darei o livramento pois somente com trezentos
eu te darei vitória
Trinta e dois mil era a quantidade
de homens a postos para pelejar
Aparentemente todos corajosos, preparados pra lutar

Porém há momentos que Deus resolve agir diferente
E o Senhor disse a Gideão ainda tem muita gente
Disse o Senhor a Gideão: Muito é o povo que está contigo
Para Eu dar os midianitas em tuas mãos
afim de que Israel não se glorie contra mim dizendo
A minha mão me livrou
Apregoa pois agora aos ouvidos de todo o povo dizendo
Os covardes e medrosos voltem

Então o povo ouviu e começou a voltar
um, dois, voltaram vinte mil
Porém há momentos que Deus quer agir diferente
E o Senhor disse a Gideão ainda tem muita gente
E disse o Senhor a Gideão
faz descer o povo as águas e ali os provarei
E há de ser que aquele que
Eu te disser esse irá contigo, esse contigo irá

Porém todo aquele que eu disser
esse não irá contigo, esse não irá
E Gideão ordenou descer as águas
e de longe começou entender que havia um
Segredo de Deus na forma que o povo água ia beber
pois quem tomasse a água com mão
E levasse a boca esse serviria
porém quem baixasse perdendo atenção esse voltaria

era escolher entre os trinta e dois mil somente

Mas trezentos com buzinas, trezentos com cântaros
trezentos com tochas, trezentos com

Fogo, trezentos que obedecem
trezentos corajosos

Por que Deus quando entra na guerra é dele o comando
é dele a estratégia, manda quebrar o cântaro
e toca as buzinas
não tente entender o trabalhar de Deus

E o resultado é vitória, vitória

vinda do verdadeiro Deus manifestarão
muitos dirão, muitos dirão, sou eu, sou eu o cristo
tendando iludir
Guerras aparecerão, nação se levantará contra nação
Escassez de alimento, .... fome, muita fome
Poderosos e fuminantes terremotos trarão muitos
mortos
isso acontecerá em todos os continentes, desde do sol
nascente até sol poente

você começar a enxergar a desolação,

esta

negada

chove aqui

Or thank my pops for all the talks
And all the wisdom he shared

Unaware, I just did what I always do
Everyday, the same routine
Before I skate off to school

But who knew that this day wasn't like the rest
Instead of taking a test
I took two to the chest

Call me blind, but I didn't see it coming
Everybody was running
But I couldn't hear nothing

Except gun blasts, it happened so fast

He forgot who he was
Or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged

She was given the world
With every chance to excel

Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell

just different faces

Changed up her pace since her daddy left her
Too bad he never told her
She deserved much better

He broke all the rules
So you would think he was cool

He was never really one of the guys
No matter how hard he tried
Often thought of suicide

Não leve em teus ombros, além do que ele te deixou
O mundo é natural, a carne é mortal
É a realidade pra chegar no ideal

O inimigo luta pra você deixar a cruz
Sem ela ele sabe que você negou Jesus
O peso da tribulação não dá pra comparar
Com o peso da glória que o céu vai revelar

Não despreze a sua cruz, ela tem sua medida
Deus um dia calculou
Ele conhece a força e a fraqueza de um pecador
O calvário declarou com o sangue de Jesus
Para o mundo o seu valor

Não despreze a sua cruz, a renúncia
É o braço de equilíbrio pra você
Hoje você não entende mas um dia irá saber
Que as pegadas de Jesus são o mapa do tesouro
Deus tem recompensa pra você

A cruz é a responsabilidade do fiel
É o domínio sobre a carne, a ponte para o céu
Diga sim pra Deus, não negue o que é seu

E ainda estão assim, e vão continuar, até um dia vê-lo regressar.
Posso pensar no que o mundo lhe tem preparado.
Sei privações tem passado e tudo por quê?
Falsos amigos por aí, conselhos vazios,
Mas cheios de palavras vãs.
Que grande ilusão, mentiram ao seu jovem coração.

Mas nunca é tarde não, sai da escuridão,
Há um novo dia, nova manhã.
A mesma casa tem portas abertas, pessoas certas,
Amigos e irmãos.

Parece sonho mas nem a distância me engana,
O coração de quem ama não pode esquecer.
Seus passos fracos, tropeções, seus olhos rebrilham e choram;
Pai, eu sei que errei, mas vim para acertar,
Permita-me de novo aqui ficar.

Pai só lamento que onde passei via muitos
Filhos sem rumo, sem teto e carentes de amor.
Que o Senhor lhes dê a mão, lhes mostre de novo o caminho,
Para um renascer, um novo proceder,
Na mais perfeita e bela comunhão.

Pra o palácio adentrar
Pra banhar, se perfumar
Se tem que mergulhar na mirra até o cheiro exalar
Tem que pôr-se vestes novas, e aprender a esperar
Pois só vai em direção ao trono
Aquela que o próprio rei manda chamar

Adornada, perfumada
E trocado o seu nome de Hadassa pra Ester
Depois disso foi chamada
Observada, cuidadosamente pelo rei
Dentre todas a mais sábia ela foi
Com temor e humildade ela chegou
E Assuero apaixonado por aquela moça
então se declarou!

Mas não foi a sensualidade de Ester
Que a atenção de Assuero conquistou
Foi o perfume da mirra exalado pelas portas
Quando ela adentrou
É assim que a igreja preparada deve estar
Pra entrar no céu quando o rei mandar chamar
Pronta para o casamento, para as bodas do cordeiro
Quando a trombeta tocar!

A igreja é Ester, preparada tem que estar
Adornada pra subir, quando o rei mandar chamar
Os portais irão se abrir, a igreja vai entrar
Novas vestes vai vestir, nada vai lhe segurar!

Vem Ester no meu trono assentar
Vem Ester tudo eu já preparei

Foi tudo uma doce ilusão
Um susto as mulheres pregaram
Não encontraram seu corpo mais não

Disseram que Ele está vivo
Que disso souberam em visão
Estava o sepulcro vazio
Mas do Mestre ninguém sabe não

Pro Cristo na glória entrar
Profetas já tinham falado
Sofrimentos devia enfrentar

E pelo caminho afora
Ardia-lhes o coração
Falava-lhes das Escrituras
Explicando a sua missão

Chegando afinal ao destino

There's a tree in the Grand Hotel,
One in the park as well,
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start,
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart.

/alceu-pires/,O Jardineiro Que Chora,/alceu-pires/o-jardineiro-que-chora.html,"Existe só um Jardineiro que chora
Ao ver cair do seu jardim uma flor
Aquela que tanto zelou com carinho
Agora lhe causa as lagrimas de dor
Durante tanto tempo fostes tão bela
Possuias o perfume do mais puro amor
Porque deixastes que o vento do mundo
Tirasse voce do jardim do Senhor

Aquele que foi teu fiel jardineiro
Seus olhos parece que os vejo chorar
Ao ver sua flor caída e morta
Na lama sem forças pra se levantar

O bom jardineiro cultivou a terra
Plantou com amor e o jardim floriu
Os crentes são a plantação do Senhor
Por Cristo na cruz do calvário surgiu
O bom jardineiro é o Senhor Jesus
O crente desviado é a flor que caiu
O vento do mundo é o que não presta
Soprou na flor até que a destruiu

Amado irmão que me ouve agora
Ainda há tempo pra você voltar
Porque o Profeta Isaias falou
Buscai ao Senhor quando se pode achar.
A tua cadeira ainda te espera
Retorne para ocupar teu lugar
Você é a flor que até hoje causou
Tristezas em Cristo fazendo o chorar.

O bom jardineiro espera ainda
A flor que caiu novamente brotar
Porque ele mesmo falou que um dia
Pra o céu o querido jardim vai Levar.

Refrão

A oração é a chave que abre a porta
da comunhão com Deus

Quando ela chega aos seus ouvidos
regada de lágrimas e de gemidos

Deus se levanta por que não resiste
ao clamor de um fiel!

Tuas necessidades todas ele atende

Basta você contar o que por dentro te machuca
o coração!

Mesmo que alguém te diga que
não tem sentido o teu clamor

Deus te responde, tem valor a tua oração

A oração faz chover!
Faz o sol parar! Faz o mal se render
e se você orar!

O anjo vai descer para guerrear
com armas poderosas por ti vai lutar!

E no final de tudo a vitoria
é tua e você vai cantar!

E você vai cantar!

E você vai cantar! basta você orar!",pt

Cause the more that I'm...
Tripping out thinking there must be more to life

Onto the next thing, I'm searching for something that's missing

Aberto o cativeiro

Fanatismo destruindo vidas

Atolados no porão da alma,

Ameaça de guerra

E me da forças pra mudar
Forças pra lutar e pra vencer

Pensava em nós
E nos via redimidos por seu sangue
Lutando o bom combate do Senhor
Lado a lado trabalhando, sua Igreja edificando

E rompendo as barreiras pelo amor.

E na força do Espírito Santo nós proclamamos aqui
Que pagaremos o preço de sermos um só coração no

Mataram, queimaram vivos
mas isso nunca os paravam
A chama que Cristo acende dentro de um coração
Nem tempestade apaga. Nem morte com seu aguilhão
A história narra profetas
homens partidos no meio
Serrados, decapitados, mas não negaram seu reino
Pregaram e transformaram a história de uma nação
Pontos remotos e tribos, onde muitos não chegarão
Atravessados por flechas, executados nas praças
Enforcados por um chamado
que queima feito uma brasa
Tudo passa, mas a sua palavra não passará
Tá consumado, o véu rasgou
e ninguém mais vai costurar
Pode bater o martelo, pode jogar na cadeia
É impossível parar uma multidão de ovelhas
Não tem na capa da Veja, também não vira notícia
Cristãos morrendo todo dia
muito mais que a pandemia
Tá escrito na Bíblia, nós temos uma missão
Ide fazei discípulos e os sinais os seguirão
O inimigo levanta, mas logo volta pro chão
Porque as portas do inferno, nunca prevalecerão

Fecharam as portas do templo, o inimigo festeja
Agora milhões de casas se transformaram em igreja
É impossível parar, nós temos uma missão
Pode tentar
mas as portas do inferno não prevalecerão (Bis)

Vou explicar uma parada
que muita gente não entende
Por que existe louvor no velório do crente?
A morte não pode afligir
aquele que nasceu de novo
O espírito vive, mesmo que matem meu corpo
Somos taxados de loucos, pelos sábios desse mundo
Viver com Cristo é louco, morrer com Ele é lucro
Não me prendo, não me iludo
tudo aqui é passageiro
Bem melhor é o que Jesus
tem guardado pros seus herdeiros
Meu governo vem de cima
e o Rei Dele habita em mim
A vitória é só pra quem perseverar até o fim
Quando tocar a trombeta, subirão os separados
Os que realmente ouviram e entenderam
o que foi pregado
Se atendeu ao chamado será um dia de glória
E pra quem desacreditou
será triste o fim da história
A hora é agora, sabemos o que está pra acontecer
E não demora, preciso revestir do seu poder
Os anjos estão acampados livrando ao nosso redor
Deus faça a sua vontade, porque a sua é melhor
Antes de voltar pro pó, e cumprir a minha missão
Te louvarei

A minha história desde o nascimento até meu atual presente
Difícil controlar, tento segurar
A vontade é de chorar, mas aqui eu sei não é o lugar

Com os inimigos olhando eu tô sempre atento
E choro representa fraqueza, sentimento
Lembro das pessoas que me amavam de verdade
Que não me abandonaram nem mesmo atrás das grades

Lembro bem dos erros que em trouxeram pra cá
E como dispensei todas as chances de mudar
Lembro que na rua os crentes me avisaram
Pra eu entregar minha alma antes do diabo ceifá-la

Dava as costas, risada
Uísque e muitas armas
Comerciante do veneno, o dono da quebrada
Lembro dos parceiros que hoje me abandonaram

Mulheres que me amavam em troca do dinheiro fácil
Nunca veio visitar, diz que é melhor evitar
Diz que é constrangedor e uma pá de blá blá blá
E o pastor leva revista quase todo dia
Pra vir pregar aqui armado com uma bíblia

Nesse momento a gente ver pra quem nós tem valor
Pra minha mãe e pro Senhor, assim disse o Pastor
Difícil crer, mas aí vou acreditar em quem?
Pra cada facada aqui o diabo diz amém!

Loucura? Deus deve é odiar essa história
Roubar, matar, traficar é nossa história
Então, o que faz esse homem vim aqui todo dia?
Que interesse ele tem distribuindo essas bíblias?

Gastar dinheiro e perder tempo comigo
Um ser que a sociedade intitulou de bicho
Um monstro jogado num depósito de lixo
E mesmo assim ele diz, pra Deus eu sou filho

(Não importa o que você fez no passado, o sangue de Cristo te purifica de todo o pecado, a sociedade pode dar as costas pra você, mas Deus nunca vai te abandonar)

Troquei idéia ontem a noite com um parceiro de x
Disse pra eu ficar ligeiro que eu tô por um tris
Eu me mantive firmão, tipo que nem abalei
Mas por dentro extremeci, quase desesperei

Morrer aqui não, meu Deus, por favor!
Ninguém pode me ajudar, nem mesmo o Pastor
Me trouxeram recado pra eu ficar alertado
Disseram que amanhã à noite eu já seria finado

(Oh, truta é melhor você abrir os olhos, se não na sua família amanhã vai ter velório, os mano tá na febre pra resolver a parada, as treta de fora é resolvida aqui na casa)

Pra onde correr? Pra onde fugir?
Aqui não tem aeroporto e não tem cherokee
Pela tv a minha mãe vai ver a notícia
Seu filho esfaqueado na mesa do legista

Tarde demais pra pensar em mudança de vida
Eu nem sei por quanto tempo ainda tenho a minha
Ontem tive direito à um telefonema
Liguei pro meu irmão e só ouvi os problemas

(Mano, a mãe tá passando mó veneno, assistiu Cidade Alerta ó, ficou pequeno, deu lá que vai ter transferência de dentento, diz que vai mandar uma pá pro interior, vai vendo, a mãe ficou nervosa quase infartou, demorou pra eu encontrar um hospital com Dr, ainda me disse que tudo aguentaria na paz, mas morreria se não pudesse te ver mais)
Eu desliguei o telefone distruido por dentro
Imaginei, cadê Jesus nesse momento?
15 minutos depois chegou o Pastor, me aliviou com a palavra do Senhor

(Assim diz o Senhor, mil cairão ao teu lado, dez mil à tua direita, mas tu não serás atingido, o Senhor é a tua proteção, ele é a tua rocha, e te livra em meio à tempestade)

Engraçado, parece que o cara ler os pensamentos
Tudo que o Pastor falou até aqui tá batendo
Esses dias ele me disse pra eu ficar na paz
Disse que eu precisava resistir à Santanás
Disse que Deus se importava com a minha vida
Me disse umas paradas que só eu sabia

Disse que Deus revelou a minha situação
Disse que viu satanás com a minha alma na mão
E toda noite eu encaro uma seção de pesadelos
Até o dia raiar é um desespero

Vejo meus inimigos bebendo e dando risada
Em cima da mesa uma jarra e o meu sangue na táça
Eu vejo um cara branco com um terno preto que vem me ameaçando dizendo desse jeito:

Você é meu, e não tem como correr, eu que fiz você lucrar, eu que fiz você crescer e agora que cê tá aí por erro seu, vai querer regenerar com esses papo de Deus?
Arrepia ó, não gosto nem de lembrar
Essas noites pra mim, custa passar

Dentro desse lugar ninguém me estende a mão

E agora o que fazer se Pedro esta na prisão?
E agora o que fazer se a igreja esta sem o pastor?

Mas a igreja sabia, disso ela não esqueceu
E a sua maior arma era clamar ao seu Deus

E incessantemente a igreja começa a orar
Pedro está na prisão
E a igreja de joelhos, Pedro continua na prisão
E a igreja continua de joelhos
E Deus responde o clamor da igreja
E manda que o anjo solte a Pedro

E ao ser liberto Pedro vai até a casa
Onde encontra a igreja reunida em oração
E ele bate a porta e diz: Sou eu, Pedro
E os discípulos dizem não acreditar ser Pedro

Mas roja a mulher diz: É ele sim, eu conheço a voz do meu pastor
E abrem-se a porta, e era Pedro mesmo
Que foi liberto pelo Senhor
Porque ali havia uma igreja
Que estava constantemente de joelhos

Quando a igreja ora é só vitória, é só vitória
Quando a igreja ora, é só vitória

Se a doença chega: A igreja ora
Se há perseguição: A igreja ora

Se a frieza toma conta: A igreja ora

Chegou dizendo pra ele que sua filha já morreu

Disse Jairo fica em paz sua filha vai ficar boa

Chega aqui e te dá esse recado!
Lembre que os mornos serão vomitados
Ou você toma postura ou já sabe o resultado!

Que existe vida após a morte
Eu também acredito
Pois fui lavado, remido
Morri pro mundo e hoje vivo por cristo
Invisto na molecada de hoje em dia
E ver o que era dor
Agora é alegria
Na favela cada um sobrevive como pode
Criança quer ser jogador
E pratica um bom esporte
Outros querem crime
Querem o malote mas eu bem sei
Que o seu fim é de morte
Eu não quero sorte
Pois tenho fé e oro
Que a salvação encontre eles
Esse é o meu suporte

De quem um dia esteve do lado de lá
Quem carregou fuzil
E hoje tem mensagem pra carregar
Era um menor aos 16
Ao ver o irmão baleado nas costas 1 2 3
Em seu tumulo chorava avingança
Mas ao encontrar com o senhor
Hoje espero sua volta como herança
Esperança, fé e o amor
Mas o amor é o maior
E eu levarei por onde eu for!

Só me traz o que é bom
O que pode separar-me
De um amor que é tão lindo?
Tão puro tão sincero nem as forças do infinito


Ta certo que eu fraquejo eu desvio meu olhar
Corrompi meu coração e a maneira de pensar
Mas tu me conheces não tem como eu esconder
Refugio e o perdão só acharei em você

Quero conhecer teus mistérios ò senhor
Compartilhar contigo a alegria e minha dor
No mais intimo de ti sentimento quero achar
E num forte abraço no teu peito desabar
Chorar no teu ombro sentar no teu colo
E contemplar sua face
Eu peço imploro e oro
Louvar o teu nome quero beijar teus pés
E conhecer - te Deus realmente como és
Morar num paraíso com estradas de ouro
Mas somente em ti acharei o meu tesouro
Fiel conselheiro juiz consolador
Razão da minha vida ES o meu primeiro amor
Nada justifica pra eu me desviar
Até mesmo na morte é com Deus que eu vou estar
Não vou virar minha face, pois não vai ser preciso
Os anjos que me guardam sei em quem é que eu confio
Em meio à rajada saraivada e coquetel se uma bala me atinge to garantido no céu
Não temas é a palavra que todo dia recebo esse é o Deus de Sadraque Mesaque e Abidinego

Refrão
e eu me apego a Deus
eu amo esse Deus
por ele eu morro e eu paro
somente a Deus
a ele eu me entrego
por ele eu vivo e eu canto


Eu choro em louvor deságuo em adoração
Sinto o poder do espírito e abro meu coração
Está na sua presença mais que maravilhoso tua unção me traz
Alegria e renovo
A quem me dera ver a paz reinar em Israel
A quem me dera não errar a quem me dera entrar no céu
A quem me dera não pecar a quem me dera não mentir
A quem me dera só louvar a quem me resistir
A quem me dera levar luz pra quem ta nas trevas
A quem me dera dar um fim nas armas e nas guerras
A quem me dera reviver os moleques que já era
A quem me dera óh senhor a quem me dera

Só em Deus...
Recebo a força de um anjo que me diz pra não desistir
Só em Deus
Deus é comigo a fé necessária pra me revestir
Só em Deus
Aprendi a sorrir vencer os vícios e..
Só em Deus entendi a amar até quem me trair

Temos que ter santidade para adquirir a intimidade
Para conseguir destruir a maldade que possa ferir
persegui obedecendo na fidelidade obti autoridade o
Poder.... a vontade de ser e de ter
O amor verdadeiro a capacidade de amar e viver

Da sede do ódio da falta de amor do homem

Oprimindo roubando sendo gananciosos

E disse ele: eu não posso
Vou pedir ao comandante deixa ele ordenar

Não decido sozinho, tenho que me consultar
Soldado ferido! o rei conta contigo!
Mesmo o sangue jorrando
E a força acabando é preciso lutar
Soldado ferido! o rei manda lhe dizer
A guerra está se acabando vence mais essa
Batalha
O rei conta com você!
Quando o comandante soube o que tinha
Acontecido
Em meio à batalha, um soldado está ferido
E pediu ao companheiro, venha me matar
Ligeiro, eu não posso
Mais andar
Enviou logo uma carta contando ao rei o que
Se passa
E o rei lhe respondeu
Oh! soldado ferido você não pode morrer, o
Rei conta contigo

De seu glorioso rei, trazida por seu

Muitos se entregam fácil e o ódio só se multiplica
Amor não se fabrica
Saiu de moda/ não faz mais diferença dentro da sua própria roda

Solução e ilusão dois caminhos diferentes
Confundem o caminho dão passos inconseqüentes

Em qual das terras você planta a sua semente
Não cave em terra com ninhadas de serpente

Soluções se colocassem em seringas
Desejava a te-la e viciaria mais do que essas cocaínas

Milhares se entregam cada dia só aumenta
São almas e mais almas cada dia se acorrenta

Uns é pelo sonho,
Outros pela ambição buscam a solução encontra só decepção

Eu digo sua alma vale mais do que um milhão
Sei que é difícil é necessário resistir à tentação

Sonhos alimenta alma com dose de esperança
Mais freqüente encontrar porção nas nossas crianças
Pois adulto já não sabe mais sonhar
Abriu as portas da ambição agora ela entrar

Nessa difusão, tudo se embaralha
Seca mares e mais mares de espírito e da alma

Tirando a essência propagando a frieza
Pureza não se encontra
Chegamos ao ponto da fraqueza
Destruímos uns aos outros derrubando a fortaleza
E sem acepção de nobreza ou a pobreza

Secando a terra tirando o sentimento real
Amor pra muitos não importa não é ideal
Se a terra já secou
Então nem vou me conformar
Lanço rima na essência para se molhar

Não entreguei meus punhos pra serem cortados
E nem meu coração pra ser dilacerado

Se procura o remédio eu já encontrei
Jesus o Salvador o Cordeiro e o Rei

Não sou nenhum boneco pra tentar manipular
Não confunda quem é guerreiro que tem brilho no olhar
Então vamos iniciar
Se quisermos seguir em frente
Vamos nos edificar
Fortificar nossa corrente
Levar sempre a mensagem mais do que sincera
Dentro de uma arena lutando contra a quimera

O maior dos guerreiros
Já venceu sua batalha
Morrendo na cruz
Fazendo que a mensagem se espalha

Não importa o meu ibope
E sim sabedoria
Se um gosta da letra
Então valeu minha ousadia

Assassinato, roubo, mais um jogado na cela
Mais como sempre, a maioria é pobre
E segue a trilha expressa o ódio com um revolver
Derrama sangue, apavorando a vizinhança
Propaga a dor, tristeza maldade vingança

Na capital da esperança chamada brasília
Quanta impunidade quantas vidas vazias
Quantas mentes insanas, ausente de alegria
Infelizmente uma vida é tirada a facada
Na qnq um mano é morto pela namorada
Já na samamba o pai vai comprar pizza pros filhos
E é assassinado cruelmente levou 5 tiros
Consigo ouvir a gargalhada do diabo
Está feliz seu plano esta sendo executado

Violência luxuria moda pornografia
Mais não informam, quantos foram transformados
Pelo poder de Deus, quantos hoje estão curados
Quem roubava, e hoje já não rouba mais
Quem traficava, agora não trafica mais

Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough

No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done

And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up
On somebody that you used to know...

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love

Em que a gente fica se perguntando..
Quais são os verdadeiros prazeres da vida..
Dessa vida bandida""

Será cocaína sua casa
Cê me ama cê ma adora
Se eu cair na sua casa você não me deixa dormir

Toda minha vida é tão minha quanto a sua
Asa que bate no céu ancestral
Não é um crime, não é delírio
É a mais pura realização
Amar ao próximo, mas me odiar
É a minha maldição.

Me deixa dormir! me deixa dormir!
Me deixa ficar! me deixa entrar!
Mas não me deixa de fora!!!!

Fecho os meus olhos, sem coordenação
Perco o controle dos meus movimentos
Então aproveite
Que está chovendo, me leve ao baile na escuridão
Vamos de devorar, te revirar ao avesso da sensação

Não consigo dormir! não consigo parar!
Não consigo pensar! mas não me deixa de fora!!

Será cocaína sua casa cê me ama, cê me adora
Se eu cair na sua casa você não me deixa dormir
Será cocaína sua casa cê me ama, cê me beija
Cocaína sua casa, você hoje dorme comigo!

Será cocaína sua casa cê me escuta, e me acalma
Cocaína sua casa você não me deixa dormir
Será cocaína sua casa cê me adéqua e me adianta
Cocaína sua casa você hoje dorme comigo

Será cocaína sua casa cê me bate e me desperta
Cocaína sua casa você hoje cuida de mim
Será cocaína sua cê me ama e me esculacha
Se eu cair na sua casa você hoje dorme comigo

Não!!! novamente não!!

Sinto mais! eu já não sinto mais!
Sinto mais! eu já não sinto mais!
Sinto mais! eu já não sinto mais!
Eu não.. sinto mais nada!!

Thankful as I stumble into future
I fall asleep in this god-given Gift
Kind of weird your absolution
Father, make them go!

Your hand touches my face
As if it glides through water
A kiss on lifeless flesh
You should have practiced what you preach!

First you asked for darkness
And now you want the sun
It's been so long since someone cared

A hostage just to have a friend
How thoughtful and how kind
Drown my head in water
Slice me into halves

You really think I'd care?

It is rather indefinable whether a dream can response to reality,
or if it is possibly more likely that the knowledge
of the existence of our subconscious being,
which sincerely rejects what is not in our definate(range of) acceptance,
can survive much longer...

However our decision may turn out,
the magic of its inspirative influence issurely the best proof
to what research has made me accept...

Metablic, schizoid indeed, s-care-ful-d we may tremble towards our future,
but still always being aware of nothing else more anxiously,
but of our dreams.

Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change

The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

Walking down the street
And distant memories
Are buried in the past forever

I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

The wind of change blows straight
Into the face of time
Like a stormwind that will ring
The freedom bell for peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away

Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky

She takes me away to that special place
And if I'd stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Oh, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain

Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain to quietly pass me by

A little high, little low

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on

Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind
And face the truth

I'd never been born at all

Scaramouche, Scaramouche

Very, very frightening me

Spare him his life from this monstruosity

I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner at the room
You've sensed something's watching you

I have constant fear that something's always near

Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving

In my thoughts I have seen
rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

Oh it makes me wonder
Oh and it makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon
if we all called the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn
for those who stand long
And the forest will echo with laughter

Woe oh
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
Don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean
for the May Queen

Yes, there are two paths you can go by
But in the long run
There's still time to change
the road you're on

And it makes me wonder

Oh

Your head is humming
and it won't go
in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?
And did you know?
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our souls
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show

How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all, yeah

To be a rock and not to roll

Oh
